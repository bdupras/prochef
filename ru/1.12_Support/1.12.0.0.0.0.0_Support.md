Getting Help With Chef
======================

#### We've tried to make the documentation on this wiki as comprehensive as possible, but inevitably folks need to get help.

  
  
  

### Chef User Help Resources

All Chef users have access to multiple help resources beyond the
information found here on the Chef Wiki.

#### Real-time Help

The best way to get help immediately is by joining the \#chef channel on
irc.freenode.net. Several folks from Opscode are there regularly (easily
distinguished by 'operator' status), as well as lots of people in the
community who have probably run into your issue or something similar
themselves. **Being a Chef user is being part of a vibrant Open Source
community!**

-   See the **[IRC](IRC.html "IRC")** page for more information.
-   **[IRC Logs](http://likens.us/logs/)** are maintained as well, which
    you can [conduct a site
    search](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/39429/how-to-search-just-the-site-youre-viewing-using-google-search/)
    against for specific information from previous discussions.

#### Chef Mailing Lists

Joining the Chef and/or Chef-Dev Mailing Lists can be an excellent way
to ask questions, and to interact and participate in discussion on Chef
use, gain tips and information on use of Chef, as well as to provide
input to product futures.

-   Sign up for the Chef Mailing Lists at
    **[http://lists.opscode.com](http://lists.opscode.com)**.

#### File a Open Source Ticket

If you've found a bug in Chef, Ohai or the Opscode Cookbooks, you'll
probably be asked to file a ticket. Our Open Source ticket tracking
system is Jira, at
**[tickets.opscode.com](http://tickets.opscode.com)**.   
  

### Hosted Chef and Private Chef Directed Support

If you are a paid customer of Hosted Chef or Private Chef, you can get
directed help from Opscode by either starting a discussion on
**[www.opscode.com/support](http://www.opscode.com/support)**, or
sending email to **[support@opscode.com](mailto:support.opscode.com)**.
*Be sure to provide as much information (as noted to the right) as you
can when creating the ticket.*

Periodic maintenance is announced in advance via the **[Opscode
Status](http://status.opscode.com/)** site, as are any emergent issues
with availability. Hosted Chef customers who use Twitter can also
receive status announcements by following the [Opscode Status Twitter
Account](https://twitter.com/opscode_status).   
  

### Training

We offer comprehensive training classes for Chef and Hosted Chef.
Classes are conducted by Opscode employees who have years of experience
working in the field of distributed configuration management. There is
also the Opscode Open Training program, which makes Opscode enterprise
training materials freely available to Chef users. See **[Opscode
training](http://www.opscode.com/training/)** for more information.
*(For a review from a recent [Chef
Fundamentals](http://www.opscode.com/training/) attendee, see [My
Impressions of Opscode Chef
Training](http://www.dlaube.com/2011/10/my-impressions-of-opscode-chef-training/).)*

For online training - within our **[Guides](Guides.html "Guides")**
you'll find a webcast of a training/lab session, a number of walkthrough
guides for the installation of common server stacks, how-to guides for
specific actions, and tutorials created by community members who were
once new to Chef themselves.

  

### Check the FAQs!

1.  **[General question FAQ](FAQ.html "FAQ")** about Chef
2.  **[Troubleshooting and Technical
    FAQ](Troubleshooting%20and%20Technical%20FAQ.html "Troubleshooting and Technical FAQ")**
    for when disaster strikes your land
3.  **[Common Errors](Common%20Errors.html "Common Errors")**
    encountered with chef-client and knife

Check these locations first, then...

### Information Required

First, gather as much information as possible about the issue. The
following is needed in almost every case.

-   Platform and version.
-   How Chef was installed (packages, RubyGems, from source, etc).
-   If using RubyGems, how it was installed.
-   Debug logs from the client. Run "`chef-client -l debug`".
-   Debug logs from the server if you are an Open Source Chef Server
    user. Set "`log_level :debug`" in `/etc/chef/server.rb`.
-   If you custom compiled Ruby (or are using REE).
-   Anything else specific about your environment that may be helpful.

**Log file locations**  
Check the server or client config file for the `log_location`.

-   /etc/chef/server.rb
-   /etc/chef/client.rb
