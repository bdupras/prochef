#### These directions provide two methods of installing Chef client on a node running CentOS, RHEL, and related Operating Systems.

  

**[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") are hosts whose configuration that you
want to manage using Chef.**

**In general, installing chef-client on a node includes:**

-   Installing Ruby and Other Dependencies
-   Installing Chef
-   Configuring Chef

**Typically, chef-client is installed on CentOS systems using one of two
possible methods:**

-   Using Rubygems, or
-   Using a knife bootstrap script

You only need to use one of these three methods on any given node.
Choose the method that makes the most sense for your environment.

**Commands Run as Root**  
Commands that require root privileges are run with `sudo` in these
directions. If your system is not configured to use `sudo`, run these
commands as root using a method appropriate for your configuration.
