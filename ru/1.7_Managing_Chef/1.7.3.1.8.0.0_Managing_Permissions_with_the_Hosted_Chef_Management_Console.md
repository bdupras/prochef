Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console
============================================================

  

### This page explains how to manage your permissions:

-   Viewing and Editing Permissions
-   Updating Billing Permissions

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, nodes or other data in
    the Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Viewing and Editing Permissions
-------------------------------

The [Hosted Chef Management Console](http://manage.opscode.com) allows
users with [grant
permissions](Hosted%20Chef%20Authorization.html "Hosted Chef Authorization")
to view and modify permissions on Roles, Nodes, Cookbooks, Databags,
Clients, and Groups. For each type of object listed, there are two
levels of permission settings: the global level and object level.

Permissions on the global level of an object type determines whether you
are able to create new objects of this type and whether you can view the
list of the objects of this type (for example, creating new groups and
listing groups). Permissions on the object level determines whether you
are able to do anything with that specific object (for example, showing,
editing, or deleting the "foobar" group).

**For more information on how permissions work, and default permissions
see the [Hosted Chef
Authorization](Hosted%20Chef%20Authorization.html "Hosted Chef Authorization")
page.**

### Viewing and editing permissions on global object levels

**Note:** Roles are used here as an example, but it works the same way
for Nodes, Cookbooks, Databags, Clients, and Groups. The permissions on
Databag Items are inherited from their parent Databags.

In order to view and update the global level permissions on an object
type (Roles in this case):

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click the *Roles* tab on the main navigation menu.

3. Click the *Permissions* tab on the sub-navigation menu, select or
deselect the permission checkboxes as appropriate, and click *Update
Permissions*.

### Viewing and updating permissions on object level

In order to view and update the object-level permissions on a specific
object (a role, in this example):

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click the *Roles* tab on the main navigation menu.

3. Click the role to view the details of the role.

4. Click the *Permissions* tab on the sub-navigation menu, select or
deselect the permission checkboxes as appropriate, and click *Update
Permissions*.

Updating permissions for the billing admin
------------------------------------------

You can also change who is the billing admin, the users that are able to
see and edit the billing information on the account:

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. If the user is not a member of the organization yet, add them to it
by following the directions on the [Managing
Organizations](Managing%20Organizations%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html#ManagingOrganizationswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-Associateausertotheorganization)
page.

3. Click on the *Groups* tab.

4. Click on the *edit* link next to the *billing-admins* group:
