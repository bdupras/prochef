***So what's the difference between a workstation and a node?***

###### A workstation *manages* Chef   
 A Node *is managed by* Chef

Your workstation *can be* set up as a client of the chef-server just
like managed nodes, but you will mainly be invoking commands and
uploading [Roles](Roles.html "Roles"),
[Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") and other Chef artifacts to the
server.

Chef itself is written in Ruby, as are Cookbooks, Knife plugins, and
Chef Exception and Report Handlers. [You don't have to be a Ruby expert
to be an effective Chef
Cook](Just%20Enough%20Ruby%20for%20Chef.html "Just Enough Ruby for Chef"),
but as you dive into Chef you will find yourself embracing Chef's Ruby
roots.

The operating system specific guides found below explain how to:

1.  Install Ruby and Chef on your workstation,
2.  Install git on your workstation, and
3.  Create and configure a chef repository on your workstation
