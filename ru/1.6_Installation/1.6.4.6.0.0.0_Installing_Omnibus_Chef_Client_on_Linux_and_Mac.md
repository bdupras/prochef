#### These directions describe the Omnibus method of installing Chef client on a node running Linux or OS X.

##### [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") are hosts whose configuration that you want to manage using Chef.

  
**In general, installing Omnibus chef-client on a node includes:**

-   Installing Embedded Ruby and Other Embedded Dependencies
-   Installing Chef
-   Configuring Chef

  

Omnibus Installation
====================

The [Chef Full Installer](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install) has been
tested with Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Oracle Linux,
Scientific Linux, and OS X.

You can install it by entering this command:

    sudo true && curl -L http://opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash

Once it is installed there will be no icon for it. If needed, you can
confirm it was installed correctly with these commands in a new command
prompt window:

    % chef-client -v

You should see "10.12.0" returned as the version number.

**Get the error "Could not find RubyGem chef" instead?**  
  
 If you get an error that looks similar to the one below, you most
likely have an issue with how your RVM is setup.

    /opt/opscode/embedded/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:762:in report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem chef (>= 0) (Gem::LoadError)

You can work around the environment variables RVM has setup by always
using 'sudo -i' with the chef-client command. For instance, this would
correctly return the version number:

    % sudo -i chef-client -v

Upon installation, this script will:

-   Install all of the embedded dependencies for Chef
-   Install an embedded version of Ruby and Rubygems
-   Install chef-client and knife version 10.12.0

After installation, you should move your validation client's private key
onto the node and copy it to `/etc/chef/`.

**Commands Run as Root**
