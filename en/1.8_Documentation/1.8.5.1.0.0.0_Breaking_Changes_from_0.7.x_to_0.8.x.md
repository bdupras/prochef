Breaking Changes from 0.7.x to 0.8.x
====================================

This page documents the breaking changes from Chef version 0.7.x and
earlier to Chef version 0.8.x

**Without a doubt...**  
The biggest breaking change is that the 0.8 series is not backwards
compatible between client and server to **any** previous Chef version.
Make sure you follow the instructions for Upgrading Chef 0.7.x to 0.8.x,
and remember that the Server will need to be upgraded before the
clients.

Authentication
--------------

We have dramatically altered the
[Authentication](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Authentication "Authentication")
model, and now rely on digitally signing each request. What you need to
know is this: when you upgrade your Chef Server, it will create a
"Validation Key" called `validation.pem`. This key should be put in
`/etc/chef/validation.pem` on all your Chef Clients, and will be used to
allow them to generate their individual client keys. Once a client has
registered, the validation key should be removed from it. Josh Timberman
has a recipe that can do this automatically for you.

REST API
--------

The [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API") has been made more
consistent, and now exists for every operation the Chef Server can
perform. It is also dramatically different in many places from the
previous API - so if you have tools that hit the Chef Server REST API,
make sure you update them.

cookbook\_path now has a more consistent order
----------------------------------------------

The configuration option 'cookbook\_path' has been reversed, so that it
goes in order from least-to-most specific. In Chef 0.7, if you had:

**Chef 0.7 cookbook\_path configuration setting**

    cookbook_path [ "/var/chef/site-cookbooks", "/var/chef/cookbooks" ]

You should now have:

**Chef 0.8 cookbook\_path configuration setting**

    cookbook_path [ "/var/chef/cookbooks", "/var/chef/site-cookbooks" ]

Search
------

The syntax for Searching inside of Chef Recipes has changed. Previously,
it was possible to return only certain attributes from a search:

**Chef 0.7 Search**

    search(:node, "ipaddress:192*", [ :hostname, :fqdn ]) do |item|
      ...
    end

In this example, the result was always a list of items that matched, and
the item itself was simply a hash with the data requested.

With the API updates in Chef 0.8, we now return full objects from search
queries - this makes utilizing them much more consistent (from a user
point of view) but means that it's no longer reasonable to return
sub-sets of the data. In Chef 0.8:

**Chef 0.8 Search**

    search(:node, "ipaddress:192*") do |node|
      node[:hostname]
    end

Will work. Notice that we're now getting the full node object itself.

In addition, the creation of custom search indexes is replaced by [Data
Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags"). If you were using the previous
custom search index functionality, move to [Data
Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags").

See the full [Search](Search.html "Search") documentation for more about
the search feature of Chef.

Run Lists, not Recipe Lists
---------------------------

In Chef 0.7 we introduced the concept of a Run List, which allows you to
mix Recipes and Roles. Due to the awesome work of Thom May, Chef 0.8
allows [Roles](Roles.html "Roles") to contain other
[Roles](Roles.html "Roles"). This means that where in Chef 0.7 you would
have written:

**Chef 0.7 Recipe List**

    node.recipes [ "apache2", "unicorn" ]

You should now be writing:

**Chef 0.8 Run List**

    node.run_list [ "recipe[apache2]", "role[webserver]" }

Your previous code will still work, but we will log a warning every time
we encounter it, and expect it to be deprecated in the next major Chef
release.

CouchDB 0.8 unsupported
-----------------------

CouchDB 0.8 is no longer supported by the Chef Server. Opscode provides
a
[recipe](http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/couchdb/recipes/source.rb)
for installing CouchDB 0.9.1+ from source, and this is handled on
supported server platforms in the
[bootstrap](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Bootstrap+Chef+RubyGems+Installation "Bootstrap Chef RubyGems Installation").
When upgrading CouchDB, you need to dump the database from the old
version and load it from the dump file.
