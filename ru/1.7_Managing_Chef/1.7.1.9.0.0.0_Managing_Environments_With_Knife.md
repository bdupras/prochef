================================

  
![image](../attachments/21397980/21463226.jpg)

Overview
--------

### Knife is a command-line tool that comes with Chef.

### It is used by administrators to interact with the Chef [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API"), the local Chef repository and can be used to manage environments within one Chef setup (or one organization on Hosted Chef).

#### Knife's `environment` sub-command provides this capability.

-   For more information about Knife, refer to the
    **[Knife](Knife.html "Knife")** documentation.
-   See **[Environments](Environments.html "Environments")** for more
    information on Environments.

**Knife commands all have the same form**

    knife sub-command [ARGUMENTS] (options)

create
------

Creates a new environment object on the Chef Server.

**Usage**:

    knife environment create ENVIRONMENT (options)

Knife will open $EDITOR and allow you to edit the ENVIRONMENT
description. Once you are done editing, knife will save the environment
to the Chef Server.

**Additional Options**:

-   `-d`, `--description DESCRIPTION`:  
     The value of the description field.

delete
------

Deletes an environment on the Chef Server.

**Usage**:

    knife environment delete ENVIRONMENT (options)

edit
----

Edit an existing environment using $EDITOR.

**Usage**:

    knife environment edit ENVIRONMENT (options)

from file
---------

Create or update an environment from a JSON or Ruby DSL description of
the environment. See [Environments](Environments.html "Environments")
for more details.

**Usage**:

    knife environment from file FILE (options)

list
----

List all the of the environments saved on the Chef Server.

**Usage**:

    knife environment list (options)

**Additional Options**:

-   `-w`, `--with-uri`:  
     Show the resource URI for each environment

**Example**:

    % knife environment list
    _default
    dev

To list nodes within an environment, use search. Within the context of
search, the chef\_environment of a node is treated like an attribute.
The following will result in a list of nodes within a the `dev`
environment:

    knife search node "chef_environment:dev"

see [Searching within
Environments](Environments.html#Environments-SearchingwithinEnvironments)
below for an additional example.

show
----

Show the information for a given environment.

**Usage**:

    > knife environment show ENVIRONMENT_NAME (options)

**Examples**:

    % knife environment show dev
    chef_type:            environment
    cookbook_versions:
    default_attributes:
    description:
    json_class:           Chef::Environment
    name:                 dev
