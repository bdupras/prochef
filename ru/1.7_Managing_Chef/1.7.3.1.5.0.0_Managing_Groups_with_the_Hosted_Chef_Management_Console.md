Managing Groups with the Hosted Chef Management Console
=======================================================

  

### The Management Console can be used to Manage Groups

-   Listing Groups
-   Viewing a Group
-   Editing a Group
-   Adding or Removing a User from a Group
-   Deleting a Group

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, nodes or other data in
    the Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Groups
------

Users, clients, and groups can be organized into groups for easier
[management of
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console").
When a Hosted Chef organization is created, there are three default
groups within the org: admins, users, and clients. By default, all
associated users get added to the users group, all existing and new
clients get added to the clients group; and the user who created the
organization account belongs to the admins group.

Users with appropriate permissions can create new groups, edit existing
groups, view current groups, and change the permissions bestowed by
membership in the groups.

Listing Groups in Your Organization

article](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
