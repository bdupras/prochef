===================

##### Shef is a way to run chef in an Interactive Ruby (IRb) session. Shef currently supports recipe and attribute file syntax, as well as interactive debugging features.

Run Modes
---------

Shef has three run modes:

-   **Standalone**  
     No cookbooks are loaded, and the run list is empty. This mode is
    the default.
-   **Solo**  
     Shef acts as a chef-solo client. It attempts to load chef-solo's
    configuration file and JSON attributes. If the JSON attributes set a
    run list, it will be honored. Cookbooks will be loaded in the same
    way that chef-solo loads them. Solo mode is activated with the `-s`
    or `--solo` command line option, and JSON attributes are specified
    in the same way as for chef-solo, with `-j /path/to/chef-solo.json`.
-   **Client**  
     Shef acts as a chef-client. During startup, it reads the chef
    client configuration file and contacts the server to get attributes
    and cookbooks. The run list will be set in the same way as normal
    chef client runs. Client mode is activated with the `-z` or
    `--client` options. You can also specify the configuration file with
    `-c CONFIG` and the server URL with `-S SERVER_URL`.
