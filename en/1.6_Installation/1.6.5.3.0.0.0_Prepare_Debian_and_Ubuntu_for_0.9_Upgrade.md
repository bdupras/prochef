Prepare Debian and Ubuntu for 0.9 Upgrade
=========================================

This document describes the steps required to prepare for updating from
0.7.x Debian/Ubuntu packages to 0.9.

**Coming Soon**  
The apt.opscode.com repository will be updated soon with the new
packages!

First, be aware of [Breaking Changes from 0.7.x to
0.8.x](Breaking%20Changes%20from%200.7.x%20to%200.8.x.html "Breaking Changes from 0.7.x to 0.8.x");
For more information about Chef version 0.9, see the [0.9.0 release post
on the Opscode
Blog](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/06/20/chef-0-9-0-and-ohai-0-5-6-released/).

Pin Package Versions
--------------------

* * * * *

First, pin the package versions of the installed Chef packages so you
don't accidentally get upgraded. On systems where Chef 0.7.x is
installed, add the following to `/etc/apt/preferences`.

**/etc/apt/preferences**

    Package: *chef*
    Pin: version 0.7*
    Pin-Priority: 1001

**Or** use dpkg to hold packages.

    for x in chef chef-indexer chef-server chef-server-slice libchef-ruby libchef-ruby1.8
    do
      echo "$x hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
    done

Important Changes
-----------------

* * * * *

-   chef-server-slices is deprecated, replaced by chef-server-api and
    chef-server-webui.
-   chef-indexer is deprecated, replaced by chef-solr.
-   The server API, webui and SOLR daemons run as `chef` user/group.
-   init scripts are configured with `/etc/default/chef*` like many
    other Debian packages.
-   chef-server-webui is optional.
-   The webui daemon process runs on port 4040.
-   The webui no longer uses openid. You will be prompted for a password
    for the `admin` user during chef-server-webui installation.
-   Registrations are now called clients.
-   Clients are validated with a certificate,
    `/etc/chef/validation.pem`. This is created when chef-server starts.
    Clients are no longer validated through the webui. See
    [Authentication](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Authentication "Authentication").

Upgrading
---------

* * * * *

When ready to upgrade the server, remove the pin entries from
`/etc/apt/preferences` and install the new version.

    sudo apt-get install chef chef-server chef-server-webui

**RubyGems**  
You should have RubyGems installed either from source or from package,
or merb will fail to launch the chef-server and chef-server-webui
daemons. Add it to the packages list here if it is not currently
installed, or install from source.

If you run into issues, see the troubleshooting section below.

After the server is up and running again, configure Knife.

    % sudo knife configure -i
    Your chef server URL? [http://localhost:4000] 
    Select a user name for your new client: [jtimberman] 
    Your existing admin client user name? [chef-webui] 
    The location of your existing admin key? [/etc/chef/webui.pem] 
    Your validation client user name? [chef-validator] 
    The location of your validation key? [/etc/chef/validation.pem] 
    Path to a chef repository (or leave blank)? /home/jtimberman/chef-repo
    WARN: Creating initial API user...
    INFO: Created (or updated) client[jtimberman]
    WARN: Configuration file written to /home/jtimberman/.chef/knife.rb

Then in your [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository"), run rake install.

    % cd ~/chef-repo
    % rake install

Your client systems will need to have the validation.pem copied to their
`/etc/chef/validation.pem`, and chef-client run, or you will need to
create clients using "`knife client create`".

Upgrade Troubleshooting
-----------------------

* * * * *

Debian packages preserve existing configuration files. When configuring
the chef-server package, `amqp_pass` may not be set, preventing the
chef-server from starting. The installation prompts for this setting,
and it gets written to `/etc/chef/solr.rb` but not an existing
`/etc/chef/server.rb`. Add the value to /etc/chef/server.rb and restart
the server.

    % sudo grep amqp_pass /etc/chef/server.rb
    amqp_pass "my_awesome_password"
    % sudo /etc/init.d/chef-server restart
    % sudo /etc/init.d/chef-server-webui restart

If the webui is installed, restart it, because when the API failed to
start, the webui doesn't get initialized and create the admin user with
the password specified.

Because the daemon processes now run as the unprivileged `chef` user,
some paths may be unwritable.

    % sudo chown chef:chef -R /var/chef /srv/chef /var/*/chef

When opening the webui (now on port 4040), the server may toss a
"Tampered with Cookie" error page. Clear out the cookie
`_chef_server_session_id` and reload the page.
