#### "Chef is like a little system admin robot ... you tell it how you want your system configured, and it will do all the dirty work."

### Chef is an open-source systems integration framework built specifically for automating the cloud.

#### No matter how complex the realities of your business, Chef makes it easy to deploy servers and scale applications throughout your entire infrastructure.

#### With Chef, you write abstract definitions as source code to describe how you want each part of your infrastructure to be built, and then apply those descriptions to individual servers.

#### *The result is a fully automated infrastructure*: when a new server comes on line, the only thing you have to do is tell Chef what role it should play in your architecture.
