\#ChefConf 2012 Call for Proposals
==================================

A few days ago, Chef turned 3 years old…

Our community has grown to over 15,000 users, and there are over 500
developers and 100 organizations contributing to and expanding Chef.

In short… we’re ready for our own conference!

In a few days we’ll be officially announcing \#ChefConf 2012, our
inaugural community conference. \#ChefConf will be held May 15-17th in
Burlingame, California. We’re really excited about what we’re putting
together.

Ahead of the formal announcement, we’re opening the Call for Proposals
now.
