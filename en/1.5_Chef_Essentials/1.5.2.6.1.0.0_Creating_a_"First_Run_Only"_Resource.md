Creating a "First Run Only" Resource
====================================

##### This page describes how to construct a resource that will perform an action on the first run of chef-client and do nothing on subsequent runs.

**Use Sparingly**  
Most resources are idempotent by construction and do not require the
methods discussed on this page. *Whenever possible, it is best to use an
idempotent resource.*

  
 One case where this would be desired, for example, is to ensure
[idempotency](Glossary.html#Glossary-GlossaryIdempotent) when a command
within an [execute
resource](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Execute)
would move the state of the node away from the desired state if run a
second time.

The ideal way to achieve idempotence when using a non-idempotent
resource is to inspect the state of the node and condition the resource
on that state using the `not_if` or `only_if` [conditional execution
resource
attributes](Resources.html#Resources-ResourcesConditionalExecution).
However, it may be difficult or impossible to correctly inspect the
state of the system, or you may never want to run the command again,
even if the system's state is incorrect.

  
**In order to create a resource that runs only on the first run of
chef-client:**

1.  set a node attribute after successfully completing the task
2.  test for the presence of that attribute within the resource.

  
The following code will run the command "command to run once" on the
first run of chef-client and will not run it upon subsequent runs:

    execute "some_command" do
      command "command to run once"
      notifies :create, "ruby_block[some_command_run_flag]", :immediately
      not_if { node.attribute?("some_command_complete") }
    end

    ruby_block "some_command_run_flag" do
      block do
        node.set['some_command_complete'] = true
        node.save
      end
      action :nothing
    end

This method has a couple of benefits over other possible approaches:

1.  Like any other attribute, the flag will be searchable:

        knife search node "some_command_complete:*"

2.  All of the flags can be unset using knife:

        knife exec -E 'nodes.all { |n| n.delete("some_command_complete"); n.save() }'
