#### Summary of discussions:

-   One cookbook == one SCM project (one cookbook per repo)
-   Less communication channels. One community =\> one place
-   Quality of shared cookbooks matters
    -   What metrics?
    -   Ticker graph for activity (downloads / version push)
    -   SCM introspection seems problematic

-   Differentiate Library cookbooks vs. more specifics
    -   Guidelines to create library cookbook
    -   Noah suggested a way to use library cookbooks while still
        introducing specific customization (ability to substitute
        templates)

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   (jtimberman) - Split opscode/cookbooks into separate repositories
