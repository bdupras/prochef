### *This is a general troubleshooting and technical FAQ document.*

##### [Common Errors](Common%20Errors.html "Common Errors") has common error messages for Chef-Client, Knife and Chef-Server - and their solutions. For an "About Chef" FAQ, see [Chef-FAQ](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/FAQ)

What is the current version of Chef? Do I need to upgrade?
==========================================================

-   The current version of [Chef is
    10.12.0](Release%20Notes.html "Release Notes")
-   The current version of [Ohai is
    6.14.0](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/10/23/ohai-0-6-10-released/)

**Private Chef** users will have migrations to new versions addressed
through a jointly developed migration plan and upgrade implementation.
Please follow up with your Private Chef administrator for additional
information.

**Hosted Chef** will always be enabled with the current version, and
with functionality sufficient to support use of pre-release versions.
When new versions of Chef and the Opscode API are released, they will be
immediately available to you on Hosted Chef – data migrations and
backwards compatibility taken care of by Opscode. You can upgrade to new
release chef-client versions and ohai clients as convenient for you, in
order to gain the advantage of new releases functionality.

**Open Source Chef** users should upgrade their chef-server(s) and
chef-clients to the newest version that provides the functionality and
bug fixes they require. Another driver for upgrades would be
availability of support resources from Opscode and the community.
[Release Notes](Release%20Notes.html "Release Notes") has a listing of
all of the current supportable versions of Chef. *Versions older than
0.9.0 should be considered obsolete at this point.*

What is an FQDN and why do I need one?
======================================

An FQDN is a "Fully Qualified Domain Name." By default, Chef Client uses
the node's FQDN to uniquely identify node names to the server if the
node name was not explicitly set.

When using
[Passenger](Chef%20Configuration%20Settings.html "Chef Configuration Settings")
or [Apache
Proxy](How%20to%20Proxy%20Chef%20Server%20with%20Apache.html "How to Proxy Chef Server with Apache")
configurations for the Chef Server, the FQDN is used for the SSL
certificate CN - canonical name.

Do you have a video, or offer training on Chef?
===============================================

*We have both!* At **[Guides](Guides.html "Guides")** you’ll find a
number of [“Walkthrough Guides”](Guides.html "Guides") that take you
step by step through the installation of 6 different common server
stacks including:

-   [Rails](Build%20A%20Rails%20Stack.html "Build A Rails Stack"),
-   [Java](Build%20A%20Java%20Web%20Stack.html "Build A Java Web Stack"),
-   [LAMP](Build%20a%20LAMP%20Stack.html "Build a LAMP Stack"),
-   and others.

With detailed documentation and an accompanying screencast, you can go
at your own pace and learn how to use Chef for your environment – all
while setting up multiple server stacks you can put to use.

There are also [“How To Guides”](Guides.html "Guides") available on:

-   [Writing a Recipe and Creating a Chef
    Cookbook](Guide%20to%20Creating%20A%20Cookbook%20and%20Writing%20A%20Recipe.html "Guide to Creating A Cookbook and Writing A Recipe"),
-   [Working with Git and
    Cookbooks](Working%20with%20Git%20and%20Cookbooks.html "Working with Git and Cookbooks"),
-   [How to Proxy Chef Server with
    Apache](How%20to%20Proxy%20Chef%20Server%20with%20Apache.html "How to Proxy Chef Server with Apache"),
-   [Deploying OpenStack with
    Chef](Deploying%20OpenStack%20with%20Chef.html "Deploying OpenStack with Chef"),
-   and others.

For a broader review of Chef, there’s a
[Webcast](http://blip.tv/opscode/why-chef-5680627) of "Why Chef" which
is aimed at users new to Chef. And, if you’d like, following
registration, we’ll be happy to send you the [Open Training
Materials](http://www.opscode.com/training/open-training/) for free.
