Exception and Report Handlers
=============================

**Exception and Report handlers are a feature of Chef that allow you to
run code in response to a Chef run succeeding or failing. The most
obvious use is to dispatch notifications if a Chef run fails, though it
is also possible to gather rich data about your chef usage for trending
and analysis.**

Anatomy of a handler
====================

A handler is a class inheriting from `Chef::Handler` and implementing
`report()` function. Before `report()` is actually run, `run_status` is
initialized by chef. `run_status` is an instance of `Chef::RunStatus`, a
class that keeps track of the chef run status (gee, there's a
surprise...). `run_status` provides several useful properties for
reporting, have a look at the table:

Name

Description

success?/failed?

Whether the chef run was successful

backtrace

The backtrace from exception, if any

exception

The raw exception, if any

formatted\_exception

The exception as a formatted string, e.g. "ExceptionClass: message"

node

The node for the client run

all\_resources

The list of all resources in the current run context's
`resource_collection`

updated\_resources

The list of all resources in the current run context's
`resource_collection` that are marked as updated

elapsed\_time

The time elapsed between the start and finish of the chef run

start\_time/end\_time

The time the chef run started or ended

run\_context

An instance `Chef::RunContext` that keep track of the context of the
chef run. It provides access several useful properties:
`cookbook_collection`, `resource_collection`, `definitions`

**A handler may be assigned as a report or exception handler, there's no
real difference in the code.** Use `success?` or `failed?` if you need
to know what situation caused it to run.

very simple report handler to make it clearer what resources were
actually configured in the Chef run.
