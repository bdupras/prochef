### The Bootstrap subcommand for Knife performs a Chef Bootstrap on the target node.

### The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server (or Hosted Chef).

  

##### The main assumption is a baseline OS installation exists. This sub-command is used internally by some [cloud computing server create commands](Launch%20Cloud%20Instances%20with%20Knife.html "Launch Cloud Instances with Knife") and the others will be migrated in a future version of Chef. It is primarily intended for [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") systems that talk to a Chef server.

**Man Page in Chef 0.10+**  
  
 Additional knife-bootstrap detail is available on your local system as
a man page. Type `knife help bootstrap` to view it.

  
As of Chef 0.9.8, the bootstrap sub-command supports supplying a
template to perform the bootstrap steps. If the distro is not specified
(via `-d` or `--distro` option), an Ubuntu 10.04 with RubyGems is
assumed. The `DISTRO` value corresponds to the base filename of the
template, in other words `DISTRO.erb`. A template file can be specified
with the `--template-file` option in which case the `DISTRO` is not
used. The sub-command looks in the following locations for the template
to use:

-   `bootstrap` directory in the installed Chef Knife library (Location
    varies depending how you installed Chef).
-   `bootstrap` directory in the `$PWD/.chef`, e.g. in
    `~/chef-repo/.chef`.
-   `bootstrap` directory in the users `$HOME/.chef`.

**Additional Options**

-   `-i`, `--identity-file IDENTITY_FILE`:  
     The SSH identity file used for authentication
-   `-N`, `--node-name NAME`:  
     The Chef node name for your new node
-   `-P`, `--ssh-password PASSWORD`:  
     The ssh password
-   `-x`, `--ssh-user USERNAME`:  
     The ssh username
-   `-p`, `--ssh-port PORT`:  
     The ssh port
-   `--bootstrap-version VERSION`:  
     The version of Chef to install
-   `--bootstrap-proxy PROXY_URL`:  
     The proxy server for the node being bootstrapped
-   `--prerelease`:  
     Install pre-release Chef gems
-   `-r`, `--run-list RUN_LIST`:  
     Comma separated list of roles/recipes to apply
-   `--template-file TEMPLATE`:  
     Full path to location of template to use
-   `--sudo`:  
     Execute the bootstrap via sudo
-   `-d`, `--distro DISTRO`:  
     Bootstrap a distro using a template
-   `--no-host-key-verify`:  
     Disable host key verification
-   `-j`, `--json-attributes JSON_ATTRIBS`:  
     A JSON string that is added to the first run of a Chef Client.

### Supported Distros

The default bootstrap templates are scripts that get copied to the
target node (FQDN). As of Chef 10.12, the following distros are
supported:

-   centos5-gems
-   fedora13-gems
-   ubuntu10.04-gems
-   ubuntu10.04-apt
-   ubuntu12.04-gems

### Authentication

`Knife bootstrap` communicates with the target node over SSH. We
recommend using key-based authentication. You can pass the path to the
private key used to authenticate to the node using the `-i` command line
option or use a program such as `ssh-agent` to manage your keys
automatically. `knife bootstrap` also supports password-based
authentication. You can use the `-P` option to pass the password
directly on the command line or, with Chef 0.10.6+, allow
`knife bootstrap` to prompt you for a password.

#### Examples

Here are two example bootstrap commands, using different types of
authentication. In this example we pass it the SSH password as part of
the command:

    knife bootstrap IP_ADDRESS -x ubuntu -P PASSWORD --sudo

And in this example, we use a private key file:

    knife bootstrap IP_ADDRESS -x ubuntu -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --sudo

Afterwards you'll be prompted for your sudo password on the node you are
SSHing into. You will want to change IP\_ADDRESS to the ip or hostname
you are trying to bootstrap, and this assumes you want to login with the
username 'ubuntu'.

#### Known Authentication Bug

*If you have not customized your ssh configuration, you will most likely
**not** be affected by this bug.*

Knife uses the **net-ssh** gem to create ssh connections to your nodes.
Currently, net-ssh processes your ssh configuration files (e.g.
\~/.ssh/config) differently than your system's ssh client. One
difference is that if you explicitly set various authentication methods
to "yes", then all authentications *not* explicitly set to "yes" will be
excluded. For example, if you set the following in your configuration
file:

    PasswordAuthentication yes

Other methods of authentication, such as key based authentication, will
not be attempted. You can fix this either by removing the explicit
authentication directive in your configuration file, or by ensuring that
**all** methods you want to use are set to "yes", even if "yes" is
typically their default value on your system. To explicitly allow
key-based authentication, use the following setting

    PubkeyAuthentication yes

For more information about this bug see
[CHEF-2783](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2783).

### Creating Custom Bootstrap Templates

Custom bootstrap templates can be created and stored in
`.chef/bootstrap/DISTRO.erb`, replacing `DISTRO` with the value passed
with the `-d` or `--distro` option. **[Custom Knife Bootstrap
Script](Custom%20Knife%20Bootstrap%20Script.html "Custom Knife Bootstrap Script")**
has a couple of examples on the creation of a custom bootstrap
template..

### Installs RubyGems and Chef as a gem

The gems installations will use RubyGems 1.3.6 and Chef installed as a
gem. A future release will install RubyGems 1.3.7, though you can
customize this yourself by copying the template to one of the locations
specified above. The apt installation will use the Opscode APT
repository.

### Writes Config Files

In addition to handling the software installation, these bootstrap
templates do the following:

-   Write the validation.pem per the local knife configuration.
-   Write a default config file for Chef (`/etc/chef/client.rb`) using
    values from the `knife.rb`.
-   Create a JSON attributes file containing the specified run list and
    run Chef.

In the case of the RubyGems, the `client.rb` will be written from
scratch with a minimal set of values, and you may want to customize it.
In the case of APT Package installation, `client.rb` will have the
`validation_client_name` appended if it is not set to `chef-validator`
(default config value), and the `node_name` will be added if
`chef_node_name` option is specified.

#### Using encrypted data bags

As of 0.10.6, `knife bootstrap` supports the
'encrypted\_data\_bag\_secret' setting in knife.rb. You will want to add
this line to your knife.rb:

    encrypted_data_bag_secret '/path/to/your/data_bag_key'

And change '/path/to/your/data\_bag\_key' to the location of where the
data bag key is located. When you run knife bootstrap afterwards it
automatically adds this line to the client.rb for the node you are
bootstrapping and copies the key over.

#### Alternate chef-client location

As of Chef 0.10.10, you can specify an alternate location for
chef-client if needed by adding this line to your knife.rb:

    chef_client_path '/usr/somewhere/bin/chef-client'

By default it uses `/usr/bin/chef-client`, but if chef has been
installed using a custom gem or an alternate ruby it might not be there.

Completed State
===============

When this is complete, the bootstrapped node will have:

-   Latest Chef version installed from RubyGems or APT Packages from
    Opscode. This may be a later version than the local system.
-   Be validated with the configured Chef Server.
-   Have run Chef with its default run list if one is specified.

### If The Run Does Not Complete

The run list for the first run of a newly provisioned node is passed in
by knife as a file with the special command line:

    chef-client -j /etc/chef/first-boot.json

At the end of the first run, the node object is saved with this list,
shows up on the console and knife commands, and is used on subsequent
chef-client runs. If the run does not complete, (the instance is created
but the installs are not completed), then the node with the run list
applied to it is never saved.

Run the above command if this occurs. The normal state is for the first
chef-client run to complete - an incomplete run is the sort of thing
that will happen while debugging changes and new recipes. A typical
cause is an unmet dependency in cookbooks. Review the metadata.rb files
of the cookbooks in your base role, or any other roles being established
in the initial run for any dependencies.

  
  
  
  

  

Is there a reason that the ubuntu10.04-gems.erb does not configure the
node to run chef automatically?  
 What is the recommended way to mutate the node after launch bootstrap
to setup automatically running chef via runit or whatever?

Check the
[README.md](https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/chef/README.md)
file from the 'chef' cookbook. I found this in there:

    The client service setup has been moved from the chef::bootstrap_client recipe into its own 
    recipe, chef::client_service. This is to improve use with Knife bootstrap which already configures 
    the client configuration file.

and further down is the description of the service itself:

    client_service

    Use this recipe on systems that should have a chef-client daemon running, such as when Knife 
    bootstrap was used to install Chef on a new system.

    This recipe sets up the chef-client service depending on the init_style attribute (see above). 
    It is included by the chef::bootstrap_client recipe.

There's also now a separate chef-client cookbook that deals only with
the chef client.
