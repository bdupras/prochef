Version Constraints
===================

Overview
--------

##### This page clarifies the syntax for cookbook versions and describes *version constraints*, which can be used in cookbook [metadata](Metadata.html "Metadata") and in [environments](Environments.html "Environments") feature to limit which versions of a cookbook should be used.

This departs from the currently documented, but not used, version
constraint features found [here](Metadata.html#Metadata-depends).

Cookbook Version Syntax
-----------------------

A cookbook version has the form x.y.z, where x, y and z are decimal
numbers representing major, minor and patch versions, respectively. A
two-part version (e.g. x.y) is also allowed.

Note that alpha-numeric version numbers, such as 3.4.rc4, and version
numbers with more than three parts (e.g. 1.2.3.4) are not allowed.

Version Constraints
-------------------

A version constraint is a string of the form "OP VERSION", where OP is
one of the operators listed below and VERSION is a cookbook version as
described above.

### Operators

-   = Equal to
-   \> Greater than
-   < Less than
-   \>= Greater than or equal to
-   <= Less than or equal to
-   \~\> Approximately greater than

Specifying `">= 2.6.5"` is an optimistic version constraint. All
versions greater than the one specified, including major releases (e.g.
3.0.0) are allowed.

Conversely, specifying `"~> 2.6"` is pessimistic about future major
revisions and `"~> 2.6.5"` is pessimistic about future minor revisions.

`"~> 2.6"` matches cookbooks `>= 2.6.0 AND < 3.0.0`  
`"~> 2.6.5"` matches cookbooks `>= 2.6.5 AND < 2.7.0`

**Requires Chef 0.10**  
The Version Constraints functionality is only available in Chef 0.10.x
and after.

What is the possible way to include multiple versions for a platform
support in metadata?   
 I would like to be able to specify the version constraint in the
following format.

    supports "ubuntu", "~> 10.04", "~>12.04"

If I use the above format, I get an error from chef saying it is not
supported. If I use simply the "\>=" constraint, it will also include
newer versions that might come in the future. Any advice would be
greatly appreciated.
