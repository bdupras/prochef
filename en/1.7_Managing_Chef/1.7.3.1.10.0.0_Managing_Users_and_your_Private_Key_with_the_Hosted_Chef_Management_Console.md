Managing Users and your Private Key with the Hosted Chef Management Console
===========================================================================

  

### This page explains how to update your user information:

-   Editing your User Profile and Changing your User Password
-   Downloading and Using your Private Key

#### And manage other users in your organization:

-   Listing Users
-   Showing User Details
-   Adding or Removing a User from an Organization
-   Adding or Removing a User from a Group

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, nodes or other data in
    the Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Editing your User Profile and Changing your User Password
---------------------------------------------------------

Your Opscode user account is shared across the Opscode Platform, the
[Hosted Chef Management Console](http://manage.opscode.com), the
[Community Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com), and
[http://www.opscode.com/support](http://www.opscode.com/support). You
can update your name, twitter account information, geographic
information, email address, profile image, and communication
preferences. Information on changing this data or your password can be
found on the [Managing your Opscode User
Account](Managing%20your%20Opscode%20User%20Account.html "Managing your Opscode User Account")
page.

Downloading and Using your Private Key
--------------------------------------

This section explains how to download and use your private key, which is
used to authenticate with [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") or directly via
the REST APIs. For security purposes, Opscode does not keep a copy of
this private key. We keep only the corresponding public key to verify
your requests. Your private key is like a password or bank PIN number,
so keep it safe.

**You can also find information on downloading the organization key and
knife config file on the [Setup Opscode User and
Organization](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Setup+Opscode+User+and+Organization)
page.**

### Downloading your User's Private Key

You will need a new key if you have lost your old key or simply want to
rotate your key for security. On the password page of the [Opscode
Account Management Tool](http://www.opscode.com/account/password), click
"Get a new key" as shown in the figure below.

Your browser will prompt you to save the new key file. Save it in the
same location as your old one, typically \~/.chef/. You should check
that knife is configured to look for your user key in the correct
location by inspecting knife.rb.

### Using your User's Private Key

The file you downloaded is a private key for the user account you
created. It is used for both authentication, "are you a valid user?",
and authorization, "are you allowed to perform this operation on this
object?". More information on this can be found on the [Authentication
and
Authorization](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization")
page.

If you open the file with a text editor (Notepad.exe on Windows,
TextEdit on the Mac, gEdit / Vi / Emacs on Linux), it should look like
the following, but the actual value will differ:

    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Any tool which sends a request to Hosted Chef on behalf of your user
account uses this key to sign the request. This includes but is not
limited to the command line tool 'knife', and the 'chef-client' which
runs on machines under configuration management.

Make sure you can find this file later. You'll need its path when
configuring other tools. Here's an example of the configuration file for
the 'knife' command line tool. Notice your user's private key file path
is referred to here as 'client\_key':

    log_level        :info
    log_location     STDOUT
    node_name        'your-user'
    client_key       '/Users/you/.chef/your-user.pem'
    chef_server_url  'http://127.0.0.1/organizations/your-org/'  
    cache_type       'BasicFile'
    cache_options( :path => '/Users/you/.chef/checksums' )

### More Information on Private Keys

For more information on public-key cryptography and on Opscode's API
request signing refer to the wiki page on
[Authentication](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Authentication "Authentication")
or

with if you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click the *Users* tab on the main navigation menu.

![image](../attachments/19923141/20086857.png)

**Note:** Listing users requires the [read
permission](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on users. Anyone associated with the organization who has the [grant
permission](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on users can grant you such permission, specifically, users in the
admins group by default have the grant permission.

Showing User Details
--------------------

Users in the admins group or who have [read
permission](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on a particular user can view the details of the particular user, such
as name, e-mail, and public key.

In order to view the details of a particular user:

1. Log in to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if

permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the particular user in order to view the user's details. Anyone with
grant permissions on the user can grant you read permissions.
