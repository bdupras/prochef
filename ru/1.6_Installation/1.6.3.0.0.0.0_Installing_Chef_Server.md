Installation Methods
====================

Choose one of the following methods to install chef-server based on the
operating system of the host

##### [Installation via Ubuntu or Debian Package](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20on%20Debian%20or%20Ubuntu%20using%20Packages.html "Installing Chef Server on Debian or Ubuntu using Packages")

On Debian or Ubuntu, install Chef from Opscode's apt repository with
apt-get. This method works with the following operating systems:

-   Ubuntu 11.04
-   Ubuntu 10.10
-   Ubuntu 10.04
-   Debian (unstable)
-   Debian (testing)
-   Debian 6 (stable)

##### [Installation via Bootstrap](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20using%20Chef%20Solo.html "Installing Chef Server using Chef Solo")

Using the bootstrap method, you install ruby with your system's package
manager, install Chef with rubygems, and then install chef-server using
a chef-solo cookbook. This method works on the following operating
system and possibly others:

-   Ubuntu 10.04-11.04
-   Debian 6.0 (stable, testing, unstable)
-   CentOS 5.6+ and 6.x (should work on RHEL, too)

##### [Manual Installation](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20Manually.html "Installing Chef Server Manually")

If packages are not available for your operating system, or you simply
enjoy staying close to the metal, you can install the Chef server
manually.
