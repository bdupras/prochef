### Session Title:

**Convener:** Steven Danna

**Participants:**

Steven Danna  
 Dan Deleo  
 Bryan McLellan  
 Marc Paradise  
 Joshua Timberman  
 Kate Leroux

#### Summary of discussions:

-   Everyone agrees docs have improved over the last year
-   Wiki is good in some places, bad in some places
-   Needed Documentation
    -   Shef!
    -   Developer Docs/documentation of internal chef api's  
         This affects are ability to make changes to internal APIs, but
        people are already using them anyway.
    -   Ruby DSL functions (related to internal api)  
         Examples that include how to translate knife commands into a
        recipe/knife exec  
         script

-   List of easy to complete documentation tasks to encourage
    participation  
     Bryan has tried this before with CHEF bugs and didn't have much
    luck. But maybe things are different now since Opscode has been more
    responsive to tickets/pull requests in general.
-   The long resources page can be intimidating
-   Quick Start needs work
    -   Currently feels long
    -   Lots of Branching
    -   Getting started with Shef instead?

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?
