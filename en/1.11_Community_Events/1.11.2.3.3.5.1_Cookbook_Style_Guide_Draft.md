Cookbook Style Guide Draft
==========================

General conventions
===================

We follow Ruby community common practices for code formatting.

-   [http://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml\#style](http://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml#style)

Highlights:

-   2 spaces for code indentation
-   Ruby blocks can be 'do..end' or {..}, use the former for multiline  
     blocks, the latter for single line
-   Do not omit parenthesis in method calls except when it is clearer
    to  
     do so.

Root files
==========

README.md
---------

-   Follows the README template
-   Attributes that are set in the attributes files in the cookbook  
     don't need to indicate default values in the documentation, as
    the  
     user can look at the file for the defaults. Do indicate what  
     calculated values are if in recipes.

metadata.rb
-----------

-   Use the Ruby DSL, the JSON will be automatically generated on  
     cookbook upload.
-   For cookbooks that have several dependencies or support several  
     platforms, use an each loop on an array of names.
-   Declare dependencies explicitly when used, rather than assuming  
     dependent cookbooks are available.
-   Use semantic versioning, [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/)

Recipes
=======

-   Follow good Ruby style practices above.

Use string expansion instead of concatenation

    # do this:
    "#{ruby_var} is cool"

    # instead of:
    ruby_var + " is cool"

-   Use `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]` as a temporary location for  
     file downloads when necessary as it will always be present.
-   Do not hard code values, it makes cookbooks inflexible and harder
    to  
     share. Use attributes instead.
-   Use libraries if recipes contain a lot of helper code.

Generating Data
---------------

-   Generate data at the top of the recipe so it can be used later and  
     doesn't clutter the resources.
-   Setting attributes that require data from sources like other  
     cookbook's attributes search or data bags should be done in
    recipes.
-   Generate data for `template` resources in the recipe and pass it
    in  
     with the `variables` parameter.

Resource declaration
--------------------

-   Be explicit for clarity, but leave Chef's defaults if it's obvious  
     what the values should be, for example default actions.

*Need specific guidelines for core Chef resources.*

Attributes
==========

-   Use 'default' to set attributes.
-   Start with an attribute space named after the cookbook.
-   Do not calculate or derive values in attributes files, use a
    recipe  
     instead.
-   Use strings for accessing node attributes.

Files
=====

-   Use with `cookbook_file` resources for binary data/files (gems,  
     .tar.gz, etc).
-   Use with `remote_directory` resources for distributing a set of
    like  
     files.
-   Use `files/default` file specificity most of the time.
-   File specificity can be useful here, but we recommend against
    using  
     host specific files, and instead use logic in the recipe as it  
     provides more flexibility.
-   Do not use `files` for distributing configuration files as it is  
     inflexible.

Templates
=========

-   Use{{template}}resources for rendering configuration files.
-   Use templates like views: contain little logic and do not use
    search  
     or other data retrieval - do that in the recipe.

Other components
================

Definitions
-----------

-   Only use definitions for very simple repeated resources that
    should  
     be named and do not contain a lot of logic.
-   We recommend against definitions, use LWRP (resources/providers)  
     instead.

Resources/Providers
-------------------

-   Explicitly set the name attribute.
-   Create a default action (not currently possible in the DSL yet,
    must  
     be a new method)
-   overload{{load\_current\_resource}}in the provider to make the  
     provider idempotent
-   Use{{new\_resource.updated\_by\_last\_action(true)}}and  
     {{new\_resource.updated\_by\_last\_action?}}so notifications work.

Libraries
---------

-   Use for adding new methods to the Recipe DSL
-   Create other helpers for providers.
-   Create heavyweight resources/providers when LWRP is limiting in  
     flexibility or namespacing.

I'd very strongly encourage/require 80 character max linelengths in code
and README.md / documentation files.
