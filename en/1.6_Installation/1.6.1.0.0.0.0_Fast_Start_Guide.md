##### This page is an install guide that describes how to get up and running with Hosted Chef as quickly as possible and ends with a fast demonstration on how to work with cookbooks.

  

* * * * *

  

Assumptions
===========

In order to make this as quick as possible, we make some assumptions.
*If your system does not meet these assumptions, you will need to use
the* *[Installation](Installation.html "Installation")* *instructions
that apply for the "flavor" of Chef you are installing.*

### Operating System

Chef runs on many popular Unix and Linux platforms as well as Max OSX
and Windows. *These install directions should work for any of the
following operating systems: Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
Fedora, CentOS, Oracle, Scientific Linux and OS X.*

There is a [Fast Start Guide for
Windows](Fast%20Start%20Guide%20for%20Windows.html "Fast Start Guide for Windows")
which go over these same directions on Windows 2008 R2. For other OS
specific instructions, go to the section of
[Installation](Installation.html "Installation") that applies to the
"flavor" of Chef you are installing, and proceed from there.

### Management Workstation as a Client

In this guide we will be setting up a management workstation as a
client. This means that the one node we setup here can be used to both
manage your cookbooks and configuration in Hosted Chef, as well as use
chef-client to run recipes on it. *(If you already have a workstation
configured and just want to add a client node, see the* *[Client
Bootstrap Fast Start
Guide](Client%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Client Bootstrap Fast Start Guide")*
*or the* *[EC2 Bootstrap Fast Start
Guide](EC2%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "EC2 Bootstrap Fast Start Guide").)*

**The Difference Between a Management Workstation and a Client**

-   *Management Workstations* have git installed so you can download and
    upload cookbooks with knife, and
-   *Clients* have chef-client configured so Chef can be run on them.

If you'd like more information on these terms, the wiki page on
[Architecture
Introduction](Architecture%20Introduction.html "Architecture Introduction")
has a very detailed explanation.

We will be setting up the client node as both in this guide.

-   Once you add more nodes you will not need to set them all up as
    workstations.
-   You do however need at least one management workstation to manage
    your client nodes.

**You don't have to set up your management workstation to be a
chef-client.** If you prefer not to:

-   Follow this guide through Step 4, and then
-   use the [Client Bootstrap Fast Start
    Guide](Client%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Client Bootstrap Fast Start Guide")
    or the [EC2 Bootstrap Fast Start
    Guide](EC2%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "EC2 Bootstrap Fast Start Guide")
    to configure a client node separately.
