AMI List for Developers
=======================

Overview

#### [Amazon Machine Images](https://aws.amazon.com/amis)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a special type of pre-configured
operating system and virtual application software which is used to
create a virtual machine within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
It serves as the basic unit of deployment for services delivered using
EC2.

**This is a list of AMIs for developers, but these are not supported by
Opscode.** These instances can be useful when developing Chef cookbooks,
allowing you to test your cookbook changes on other platforms without
having to build a Virtual Machine image. They can also be useful if you
are having issues with a particular AMI, to see if the issue occurs on
other AMIs as well.

**These do not have chef-client pre-installed and are meant to be used
with the knife-ec2 plugin.**

-   If you have not used the knife-ec2 plugin before, there is an [EC2
    Bootstrap Fast Start
    Guide](EC2%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "EC2 Bootstrap Fast Start Guide")
    that can help get you started.
-   The bootstrap file listed is the one most likely to work with this
    AMI, if it does not work or there is not one listed you can try
    creating a [Custom Knife Bootstrap
    Script](Custom%20Knife%20Bootstrap%20Script.html "Custom Knife Bootstrap Script").

**These are collected and maintained by the community and their
compatibility with Chef is not guaranteed.**
