    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an

    and make the appropriate selection.**

Listing Roles in the Organization

Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click *Roles* on the main navigation menu.

**Note:** You need [list
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global roles level to see the list of roles.

Viewing a Role
--------------

Viewing a role shows the recipes and roles included in the role, as well
as a tree view of the attributes associated with the role.

In order to view a specific role:

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click *Roles* on the main navigation menu.

3. Click on the name of the specific role you want to view. This will
bring you to a page where you can see the run\_list and attributes for
the role:

![image](../attachments/19923237/20086940.png)

**Note:** You need [read
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the role to view it.

Creating a Role
---------------

The role create page allows you to create a role. You can add recipes
and roles to the run list. There is also a JSON editor for editing,
adding and removing JSON attributes associated with the role.

In order to create a role:

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and navigate to the *Roles* tab.

2. Make sure that the correct environment is selected at the top of the
screen, select *None* if you want this role to work the same on all
environments. Click *Create* on the sub navigation bar.

3. Give the role a name and an optional description.

4. Continue onto editing the role, by adding to it's run\_list and
editing the attributes. This is described further in the [next
section](#ManagingRoleswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-EditingaRole).

5. When you have finished editing the role, click *Create Role* to save
the new role.

If you selected a custom environment and need the run list setup
differently with another environment, you can now change the environment
and edit the run list. If an environment is selected from the drop down
at the top of the page, you will only see the run\_list and attributes
specific to this environment. You can see the default run list and
attributes by selecting *None* or \_*default* from the drop down.

**Note:** You need [create
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global roles level to create new roles.

Editing a Role
--------------

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and navigate to the *Roles* tab.

2. Make sure that the correct environment is selected at the top of the
screen, select *None* if you want this role to work the same on all
environments. Click on *edit* next to the role you want to edit.

3. To **add** a role or recipe to the role being edited, drag it from
*Available Roles* or *Available Recipes* to *Run List*:

4. To **remove** a role or recipe from the role being edited, drag it
from the *Run List* back to an *Available* section:

![image](../attachments/19923237/20086942.png)

The *Active Run List* panel on the right shows the current active run
list for the environment selected with the drop down box at the top of
the page. If the *None* or \_*default* environments are selected it
shows the default run list. If you've selected an environment that does
not have a specific run list yet it will also show the default run list.
If you edit the run list while an environment is selected at the top of
the page, your changes will be saved as a run list specific for nodes in
that environment.

5. Click *Save Role* to save.

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the role to edit it.

### Modifying Role Default and Override Attributes

You can edit the override [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") of
a role, to override the values of an included recipe or role, and you
can edit the default attributes of a role to specify attributes that do
not exist in included recipes and roles. You can use the *Editor* or
*Source* tabs on this page to edit the attributes. With the *Editor* tab
you can edit the attributes by selecting the location on the tree and
adding the details. You can use the *Source* tab to paste in JSON
directly.

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the role to edit the attributes.

#### Using the *Editor* tab

1. Click on the plus sign next to "json" and select "default" or
"override" from the tree on the left, depending on the type of attribute
you want to create. If you're unsure, you should select "default" unless
you are trying to override a default attribute that is already set in
the node or in a recipe.

2. Click on the *Editor* tab on the right.

3. Push the green add button under the *Editor* tab:

4. Select a type of attribute from the drop down box. If you are unsure,
you most likely want "string" if the value is text, or "number" if the
value is a number.

5. Enter a name as the key and a body as the value and click *Add
Attribute*. The following figure shows the Default and Override
Attributes tree and the JSON editor.

6. Click the *Create Role* or *Save Role* button to save the role.

#### Using the *Source* tab

1. Enter the JSON body in the editor, and click the *Load JSON from
source* button: ![image](../attachments/19923237/20086948.png)

2. Click the *Create Role* or *Save Role* button to save the role.

Editing the Roles on a Node's Run List
--------------------------------------

To edit the roles that are in a node's run list, follow the [Managing
Nodes](Managing%20Nodes%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html#ManagingNodeswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-EditingaNode)
page. You can also use [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") to edit the run list
for the node.

Deleting a Role
---------------

In order to delete a role:

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and navigate to the *Roles* tab.

2. Click the *Delete* link next to the name of the role you want to
delete, and click *OK* on the confirmation message box. Or, click the
role to view its details, and click *Delete* on the sub navigation menu.

**Note:** You need [delete
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the role to delete it. If you don't have delete permissions, you may
not see a *Delete* link or tab.
