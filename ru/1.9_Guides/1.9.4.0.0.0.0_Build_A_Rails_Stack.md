#### Build a Rails application stack using Chef cookbooks available from the [Cookbooks Community Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) and Hosted Chef.

**At the end of this guide, you'll have four total Ubuntu 10.04 systems
running in Amazon EC2.**

-   1 haproxy load balancer.
-   2 Ruby on Rails application servers.
-   1 MySQL database server.

If you don't already have an account with Amazon AWS, go to [Amazon Web
Sevices](http://aws.amazon.com/) and click "Sign up". You'll need the
access and secret access key credentials from the sign-up later.

  
 The Ruby on Rails application used in this guide is [Radiant
CMS](http://radiantcms.org/).

We're going to reuse a number of cookbooks from the [Cookbooks Community
Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) to build the environment. For
example:

-   The source code lives in **git**, so that cookbook will ensure Git
    is available.
-   The load balancer is **haproxy** because it is very simple to deploy
    and configure, and we use a recipe that automatically discovers the
    Rails application systems.
-   The heavy lifting is handled by recipes in the **application** and
    **database** cookbooks.
-   Finally, as we're deploying Radiant, we'll get some help from the
    **radiant** cookbook.
