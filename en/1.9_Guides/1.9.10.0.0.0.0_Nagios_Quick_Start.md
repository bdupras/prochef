#### Build a Nagios monitoring server using Chef cookbooks available from the [Cookbooks Community Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) and Hosted Chef.

The Walkthrough Guide assumes you followed the [Fast Start
Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide") and have Chef
installed and working with the Hosted Chef platform.

**At the end of this guide, you'll have one Ubuntu 10.04 system running
Nagios in Amazon EC2.**

If you don't already have an account with Amazon AWS, go to [Amazon Web
Sevices](http://aws.amazon.com/) and click "Sign up". You'll need the
access and secret access key credentials from the sign-up later.

  
 We are going to reuse a few cookbooks from the [Cookbooks Community
Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) to build the environment. The
**nagios** cookbook is required, of course. The Nagios web interface
will be set up with **apache2**. Finally, we will need the **apt**
cookbook to ensure the package cache is updated.

If you do not already have an account with Amazon AWS, go to [Amazon Web
Sevices](http://aws.amazon.com/) and click "Sign up". You will need the
access and secret access key credentials from the sign-up later.
