Deploying OpenStack with Chef
=============================

Overview
========

![image](../attachments/11141177/13238276.jpg)   
This page is a brief guide to deploying OpenStack with the cookbooks
currently available from Matt Ray's GitHub repository
([http://github.com/mattray/openstack-cookbooks/tree/cactus](http://github.com/mattray/openstack-cookbooks/tree/cactus)).
It is currently intended for deploying the point-release codenamed
"Cactus", other branches will be added as they are released ("Bexar" is
still available as a branch). The intention for the repository is to
only support major releases.

This code base is under development, so ask [Matt
Ray](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/~matt) about the current state if
these instructions aren't currently working.   
  

Status
------

Right now the Cactus cookbooks support a single machine with Glance and
Nova, but they are under active development. Other components will be
added in time and new releases will be added as they are available.
There is currently no intention to continue development on previous
releases once a new release is available (but they are available and
patches are welcome!). The eventual goal is to support all the
configuration options available for OpenStack with Chef cookbooks.

All code in the repository is Apache 2 licensed and covered by the
[Contribution License
Agreement](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute"). Patches will
not be accepted without this requirement.

Requirements
------------

This has been primarily tested with Ubuntu 10.04 (a bit with 10.10) and
Chef 0.10 and later.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

-   OpenStack Compute currently requires x86 hardware with
    virtualization support (KVM is currently the only hypervisor).
-   OpenStack Object Storage should not be deployed with RAID.

OpenStack
=========

What is OpenStack?

> OpenStack is a collection of open source technologies delivering a
> massively scalable cloud operating system. OpenStack is currently
> developing two interrelated projects: [OpenStack
> Compute](http://openstack.org/projects/compute) and [OpenStack Object
> Storage](http://openstack.org/projects/storage). OpenStack Compute is
> software to provision and manage large groups of virtual private
> servers, and OpenStack Object Storage is software for creating
> redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of commodity servers
> to store terabytes or even petabytes of data.

-   **OpenStack Compute**, code-named *“Nova”*, provides the software to
    provision virtual machines on standard hardware on a massive scale.

-   **OpenStack Image Registry**, code-named *"Glance"*, provides
    services for discovering, registering, and retrieving virtual
    machine images.

-   **OpenStack Object Storage**, code-named *“Swift”*, provides the
    software to store billions of objects distributed across standard
    hardware.

Code
====

The cookbooks and configuration files are currently available from [Matt
Ray's GitHub
repository](http://github.com/mattray/openstack-cookbooks/tree/cactus).

*(note the "cactus" branch)*

    git clone git://github.com/mattray/openstack-cookbooks.git

These were originally forked from the work in [Anso Labs'
OpenStack-Cookbooks](https://github.com/ansolabs/openstack-cookbooks)
but have diverged greatly since the original fork.

**Matt Ray talks Crowbar, Chef, and OpenStack integration for building
private clouds**  
  
[Matt Ray](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/~matt) discusses the
integration work he is doing with
[Crowbar](http://robhirschfeld.com/2011/03/14/how-openstack-installer-works/)
(a soon to be open source bare-metal provisioning tool from
[Dell](http://www.dell.com/)), [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/products/),
and [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/). This toolchain stretches the
concept of infrastructure as code all the way from the bios to the
provisioning of a private cloud... it's a "datacenter as code".
