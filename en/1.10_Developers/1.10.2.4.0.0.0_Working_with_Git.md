**Chef Project Development**  
This page describes the workflow used for working on the Chef and
related projects ([Ohai](Ohai.html "Ohai"), mixlibs, etc) source code.

Initial setup of development repository
=======================================

1.  Setup a github account
2.  Fork the repositories  
    ![image](../attachments/7274751/7634953.png)
3.  Clone the repositories locally

        $ git clone git@github.com:yourgithubusername/chef.git

4.  Enter the chef directory and add an opscode remote

        $ cd chef/
        $ git remote add opscode git://github.com/opscode/chef.git

    You'll be able to see if this is successful with git config:

        $ git config --get-regexp "^remote\.opscode"
        remote.opscode.url git://github.com/opscode/chef.git
        remote.opscode.fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/opscode/*

5.  Adjust your branch to track the opscode master remote branch, by
    default it'll track your origin remote's master:

        $ git config --get-regexp "^branch\.master"
        branch.master.remote origin
        branch.master.merge refs/heads/master

    Change it with the following:

        $ git config branch.master.remote opscode

Keeping your 'master' up-to-date!
---------------------------------

Once all this is done, you'll be able to keep your local master up to
date with the simple command:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull --rebase

Alternatively, you can synchronise your master from any branch with the
full fetch/rebase syntax:

    $ git fetch opscode
    $ git rebase opscode/master master

Using rebase pull will do a rebase instead of a merge, which will keep a
linear history with no unecessary merge commits. It'll also rewind,
apply and then reapply your commits at the HEAD.

Use [this Rakefile](../attachments/7274751/7634952) to update chef, ohai
and cookbooks repos (edit as needed).

Working on topic branches
-------------------------

So you want to do some work? *Don't put your commits directly in your
master branch!* It is important to use a 'topic branch' when working on
a large project like Chef. The key to this concept is that each topic
branch solves a single and unique problem and should usually be
logically organized in the same was as a ticket on the issue tracker. A
good example is a branch that adds support for a new init system, or
resolves a bug when running under a specific version of CentOS. We
prefer that topic branches be named after the bug that they solve so
that someone with the same issue can easily find your commits in the
'git log'.

If your topic branch solves multiple bugs, reconsider if your branch is
perhaps too broad. What if the person merging the contribution finds an
issue with part of the branch but not another? Sometimes when you
refactor a large piece of the code-base, you resolve multiple bugs and
it is better to put individual issue numbers in the commit messages. One
solution doesn't fit all, so use your best judgement.

1.  Create an appropriately named tracking branch!

        $ git checkout --track -b CHEF-XX opscode/master

    Setting a topic branch up to track opscode/master allows you to
    easily rebase your commits in preperation for merge.

2.  Do work

        hack
        hack

3.  Commit (see step two if more work remains)

        $ git status
        $ git commit <filespec>

4.  Rebase your commits against opscode/master  
     After your work is finished in the local topic branch, you should
    rebase you commits against the upstream master. This will
    temporarily remove your local commits, update the branch from
    upstream, and then reapply your local commits. You can either do
    this manually with 'fetch' then 'rebase', or use the 'pull --rebase'
    shortcut.  
      
     If there are any problems doing so, git will let you know and stop.
    This is important because it ensures that those that will merge your
    contribution into the upstream master won't have to resolve
    differences between your changes and the current branch to include
    your contribution. If you encounter merge conflicts, you should fix
    the files as directed and then mark as fixed with 'git add', and
    then continue rebasing with 'git rebase --continue'. At any stage,
    you can abort the rebase with 'git rebase --abort'.   
      
    **Rebase your commits with fetch + rebase**

        $ git fetch opscode
        $ git rebase opscode/master CHEF-XX

    **Rebase your commits with the tracking-branch shortcuts**

        $ git pull --rebase

5.  Push a remote branch

        $ git push origin CHEF-XX

Job's done!
-----------

Don't forget to send a pull request and update the ticket. Once your
work has been merged by the branch maintainer, it will no longer be
necessary to keep the local branch or remote branch, so you can remove
them!

1.  Sync your local master up:

        $ git checkout master
        $ git pull --rebase

    Remove your local branch using -d to ensure that it has been merged
    by upstream. Branch -d will not delete a branch that is not an
    ancestor of your current head. From the git man page:

        -d

            Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in HEAD.
        -D

            Delete a branch irrespective of its merged status.

2.  Remove your local branch

        $ git branch -d CHEF-XX

3.  Remove your remote branch by using the full syntax to 'push', and
    omitting a source branch.

        $ git push origin :CHEF-XX
