Encrypted Data Bags
-------------------

[Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags") are a great way to store and
access data infrastructure wide, so long as it isn't associated directly
with node or role [attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes").

##### Encrypted Data Bags allow sensitive information, such as database passwords, to be stored in data bags in an encrypted form.   
  
 This protects the sensitive data from exposure if the Chef server is compromised and allows the data bag to be managed in a source control system without having plain-text passwords in revision history.

  
 Only designated nodes will be able to decrypt values stored in an
encrypted data bag because a shared secret is required for decryption.

**Encrypted Data Bags provide the following features**

1.  Only the values of data bag items are encrypted, so that keys are
    still searchable.
2.  The system uses shared key encryption; **users distribute the shared
    key to authorized nodes and users**.
3.  Recipes can load encrypted data bags and access values like regular
    [Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags"). Decryption relies on the
    shared secret being present in a file on the node or accessible via
    a URI path.
4.  Encrypted Data Bag support is integrated into knife. The
    `knife data bag *` commands make it possible to create, edit, and
    show encrypted data bags using the `--secret` and `--secret-file`
    options.

The only enhancement that might be nice is some sort of way to
selectively choose which values will be encrypted in a databag item.
Could we do this through some sort of key naming convention (enc\_pass
vs pass)? I could see only needing to encrypted a few values in the data
bag item. If we did something like this you could just always use
Chef::DataBagItem.load which would presumably know what values to
decrypt.

I was expecting that you would segregate sensitive values into their own
data bag. The naming convention could be convenient, but I worry that it
could catch someone by surprise if a key matches the convention by
accident and breaks.
