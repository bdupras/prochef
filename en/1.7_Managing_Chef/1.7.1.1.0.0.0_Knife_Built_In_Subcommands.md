#### Subcommands for managing components from the Knife command line interface

* * * * *

#### This page contains documentation for each of the built-in knife sub-commands as well as popular plugins.

#### Many sub-commands are documented on their own pages, though all are listed here for completeness.

**Knife commands all have the same form**

    knife sub-command [ARGUMENTS] (options)

[Common Options](Knife.html#Knife-CommonOptions) provides detail on the
options can be passed to any subcommand, while sub-command specific
options are reviewed in the relevant section of this page. [Output
Formats](Knife.html#Knife-OutputFormats) information on the amount of
content displayed and modification options for the output.

For all commands and subcommands, there is [Contextual
Help](Knife.html#Knife-ContextualHelp) for the options available,
including direct access to manpages.

##### Knife sub-commands are structured such that commands have the form: `NOUN verb NOUN` (options).

Because the Chef Server API is RESTful, the `verb` of a knife command is
generally a CRUD operation:

-   **create** (create)
-   **list** and show (read)
-   **edit** (update)
-   **delete** (destroy)
