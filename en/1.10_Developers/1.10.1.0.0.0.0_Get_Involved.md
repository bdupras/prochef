### How to help

There are many ways to help with the project.

-   Assist other users on the [Mailing
    Lists](Mailing%20Lists.html "Mailing Lists") or on
    [IRC](IRC.html "IRC").
-   Scratch your own itch and add features
-   Improve the code by adding unit tests to uncovered code
-   Add wiki documentation, such as how to run and write unit tests
-   Review [old] open [tickets](http://tickets.opscode.com) and ensure
    they are [still] reproducible
-   ... and then provide a fix for that ticket
-   Review github pull requests for projects that don't have an
    associated ticket number and find it, or ask the contributor for
    one.
-   Add small or concise tasks to the list below to help people get
    started

### Specific projects

These items could be completed by anyone. This list shouldn't be work
you want someone to do for you, but rather small projects that you think
someone new to the project could pick up and help with.

-   [CHEF-1771](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1771) adds
    support for configuring certain EC2 values to your knife
    configuration file. It may need to be moved to the KNIFE-EC2
    project. Last we knew, it was breaking a number of spec tests and
    could use some work.

-   Someone familiar with debian/ubuntu should try to figure out why the
    [packaging](http://github.com/opscode/opscode-packages) for Chef
    still sometimes fails when rabbitmq is already configured. The
    success of this differs on releases, so even just testing a release
    and documenting what you tried and what the result was would help.
    Relevant tickets are
    [CHEF-2472](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2472) and
    [CHEF-2296](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2296). It looks
    like CHEF-2296 has a fix, it just needs to be written into
    [http://github.com/opscode/opscode-packages](http://github.com/opscode/opscode-packages).

-   [CHEF-1367](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1367) came up
    with ideas on how to make remote\_file not download a file if it
    hadn't changed, but the original reporter never completed a CLA so
    we need to do this work ourselves. Tollef did something similar for
    the http\_request resource in
    [CHEF-1577](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1577) so it
    should be pretty easy to do here as well, although that might
    eventually mean upfactoring some shared code.

-   The community drupal cookbook could stand to have the final
    installation steps automated with drush. More information in
    [COOK-976](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-976).
