Managing Cookbooks with the Hosted Chef Management Console
==========================================================

  

### Using the Management Console to Manage your Cookbooks provides for:

-   ##### Listing Cookbooks

-   ##### Viewing Cookbook Contents

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, nodes or other data in
    the Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Listing Cookbooks in the Organization

you are associated with multiple organizations.

list of cookbooks that have been uploaded to the Hosted Chef Server:

permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global cookbooks level in order to see the list of cookbooks.

Viewing the Contents of a Specific Cookbook

To view the contents of a specific cookbook:

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click *Cookbooks* on the main navigation menu.

4. Click on *Library Files*, *Attribute Files*, *Definition Files*,
*Recipe Files*, or *Template Files* to view the contents of the
cookbook. If you do not see one of these links, the cookbook does not
have files of that type.

**Note:** You need [read
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the specific cookbook in order to view the details of the cookbook.
