**Learn how to contribute to Opscode projects**  
Before you contribute to Opscode projects, please be sure you have
followed the general steps on [How to
Contribute](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute"), which
includes signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

Overview
========

The general steps are:

1.  Create a ticket in our JIRA.
2.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
3.  Clone the repository on your local system.
4.  Create a branch and make your changes.
5.  Push the branch, create a pull request and resolve the ticket.

Read on for detailed steps, including a script to handle initial setup
for all the repositories.

Contributing to Opscode Cookbooks
=================================

Below, replace "COOKBOOK" with the cookbook that should be changed.
Replace "USER" with your GitHub username.

0. Create a ticket for the bug, feature or improvement you are
contributing.

-   [http://tickets.opscode.com](http://tickets.opscode.com)

1. Fork the repository on GitHub. For a script to do this for all the
repositories, see the end of this article.

    opscode-cookbooks/COOKBOOK -> USER/COOKBOOK

You can replace COOKBOOK in your fork with a name for the repository  
 that makes it unique, if required.

2. Clone the repository locally

    git clone git@github.com:USER/COOKBOOK.git

3. Ensure the origin is your repository.

    git config remote.origin.url git@github.com:USER/COOKBOOK.git

4. Add opscode-cookbooks as a remote named \`opscode\` and track it  
 instead of your origin.

    git remote add opscode git://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/COOKBOOK.git
    git config branch.master.remote opscode

5. Make sure your master branch is updated.

    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase

6. Create a new branch for the ticket.

    git checkout -b COOK-####

7. Make your changes and push the branch to your origin.

8. Resolve the COOK ticket and link to your pull request in a comment.

Script to Fork and Clone Repos
==============================

![image](images/icons/emoticons/check.gif)

**This is for all the Opscode cookbook repositories**  
This script will retrieve the full list of **all** the Opscode Cookbook
repositories and fork them all on your GitHub account.

Install the `git`, `github_api`, `rest-client`, and `json` RubyGems.

This will clone the repositories on your local system to
"`~/Development/opscode/cookbooks`". You can modify the `BASE_PATH`
constant to change this.

Replace the value for the `USER` and `GHPW` constants with your values.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'github_api'
    require 'rest-client'
    require 'json'
    require 'git'

    BASE_PATH = File.join(File.expand_path("~"), "Development", "opscode", "cookbooks")
    puts "Cookbook repositories will be cloned to #{BASE_PATH}"
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(BASE_PATH)
    Dir.chdir(BASE_PATH)

    # We use basic auth so we don't need to setup OAuth
    USER = "your-github-username"
    GHPW = "your-github-password"

    gh = Github.new(:user => USER, :basic_auth => "#{USER}:#{GHPW}")

    # We use rest-client instead of github_api because the latter paginates results
    cookbook_repos = JSON.parse(RestClient.get("https://api.github.com/orgs/opscode-cookbooks/repos"))

    repos_list = cookbook_repos.map {|r| r['name']}

    repos_list.each do |r|
      puts "Forking #{r} for #{USER}"
      gh.repos.create_fork('opscode-cookbooks', r)
      puts "Cloning #{r} to #{BASE_PATH}"
      cb = JSON.parse(RestClient.get("https://api.github.com/repos/#{USER}/#{r}"))
      g = Git.clone(cb['git_url'], r)
      g.add_remote('opscode', cb['parent']['git_url'])
      g.config('remote.origin.url', cb['ssh_url'])
      g.config('branch.master.remote', 'opscode')
    end

create\_fork() for the script above doesn't exist. I poked around at it,
but I fail.
