Overview

##### Knife is a command-line tool that comes with Chef.

##### It is used by administrators to interact with the Chef [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API"), the local Chef repository and and can be used to interact with cookbooks on the Chef Server and on the Cookbook Site.

  

#### Knife's `cookbook` and `cookbook site` sub-commands provide this capability.
