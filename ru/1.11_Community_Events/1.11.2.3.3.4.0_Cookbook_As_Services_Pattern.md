 Wow...like 60 people

#### Summary of discussions:

Greg Althaus did session showing how Crowbar uses Roles to track
application configuration information  
 Rob talked about the use case of Crowbar being to use Chef as an
installer, needed to keep recipe logic more locked  
 idea: Crowbar is using Roles as something else, perhaps there are
missing object types in Chef.
