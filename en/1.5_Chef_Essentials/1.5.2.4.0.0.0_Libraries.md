Libraries
=========

  

![image](../attachments/1179806/21463235.png)   

Libraries allow you to include arbitrary Ruby code, either to extend Chef's language or to implement your own classes directly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### They are the secret sauce that will allow you to plug in to your existing infrastructure and utilize it to inform how your systems are configured.

  

  

**Libraries are defined in your\_cookbook/libraries/library\_name.rb.**

-   Any libraries you include in a
    [Cookbook](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") will automatically be
    required, and available within all your
    [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes"), [Attribute
    Files](Attributes.html "Attributes"),
    [Providers](Providers.html "Providers") and
    [Definitions](Definitions.html "Definitions").
-   What this means is that the library files will automatically be read
    - however you may need to do something else to actually use them,
    depending on their contents.

Here's a simple example, showing how you'd use module defined in a
Library in your recipe:

**your\_cookbook/libraries/your\_example\_library.rb**

    # define a module to mix into Chef::Recipe
    module YourExampleLibrary
      def your_function()
        # ... do something useful  
      end
    end

**your\_cookbook/recipes/default.rb**

    # open the Chef::Recipe class and mix in the library module
    class Chef::Recipe
      include YourExampleLibrary
    end

    your_function()

Basic Libraries
---------------

Lets say you have a customer record you are storing in an attribute
file, that looks like this:

**A customer attribute file**

    mycompany_customers({
      :bob => {
        :homedir => "/home/bob",
        :webdir => "/home/bob/web"
      }
    }
    )

In a recipe, you could say:

**Simple recipe**

    directory node[:mycompany_customers][:bob][:webdir] do
      owner "bob"
      group "bob"
      action :create
    end

But that feels verbose, and you are going to do it all the time. You
would rather say:

**Advanced recipe**

    directory customer(:bob)[:webdir] do
      owner "bob"
      group "bob"
      action :create
    end

You could achieve that with a simple library, like this:

**Library to extend Chef::Recipe**

    class Chef
      class Recipe    
        # A shortcut to a customer
        def customer(name)
          @node[:mycompany_customers][name]
        end
      end
    end

Lets say you wanted some code to easily loop over every customer, like
this:

**Loop over customers**

    all_customers do |name, info|
      directory info[:webdir] do
        owner name
        group name
        action :create
      end
    end

You could have a library like this:

**Loop over customers**

    class Chef
      class Recipe
        def all_customers(&block)
          @node[:mycompany_customers].each do |name, info|
            block.call(name, info)
          end
        end
      end
    end

Advanced Library Usage
----------------------

You can also use Libraries to connect up to databases, talk to LDAP, or
do anything else you can do with Ruby.. which is basically anything.  
 If you are going to go too crazy, consider putting your libraries in a
new namespace, and calling them directly from your Chef
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") - that way, there won't be too much
pollution of the Chef::Recipe namespace.

Here is an example of connecting to a database and returning a list of
customer Virtual Hosts.

**Virtual Hosts from a Database**

    require 'sequel'

    class Chef::Recipe::ISP
      # We can call this with ISP.vhosts
      def self.vhosts
        v = []
        @db = Sequel.mysql(
          'web', 
          :user => 'example', 
          :password => 'example_pw', 
          :host => 'dbserver.example.com'
        )
        @db[
          "SELECT virtualhost.domainname, 
                  usertable.userid, 
                  usertable.uid, 
                  usertable.gid, 
                  usertable.homedir
             FROM usertable, virtualhost
            WHERE usertable.userid = virtualhost.user_name"
          ].all do |query|
          vhost_data = {
            :servername   => query[:domainname],
            :documentroot => query[:homedir],
            :uid          => query[:uid],
            :gid          => query[:gid],
          }
          v.push(vhost_data)
        end
        Chef::Log.debug("About to provision #{v.length} vhosts")
        v
      end
    end

**This rocking example..**  
Was provided by Arjuna (fujin). He's awesome.

  
 You could then use this in a recipe like so:

**Using ISP.vhosts in a Recipe**

    ISP.vhosts.each do |vhost|
      directory vhost[:documentroot] do
        owner vhost[:uid]
        group vhost[:gid]
        mode 0755
        action :create
      end

      directory "#{vhost[:documentroot]}/#{vhost[:domainname]}" do
        owner vhost[:uid]
        group vhost[:gid]
        mode 0755
        action :create
      end
    end

  
  
  
  

  

NB Subdirectories in the libraries folder are **not synced with
clients**

It would be nice if cookbook libraries could be included in other
cookbook libraries.

It seems to sporadically work if you have a cookbook depend on another
cookbook; however, since there does not seem to be any ordering done
during the loading of the libraries it will sometimes succeed and
sometimes fail depending on how the libraries got loaded. It would be
nice if the loading of libraries was determined by the cookbook
dependencies.

I would love to have something like this:

cookbook-1 (no dependencies)  
 cookbook-2 (depends on cookbook-1)  
 cookbook-3 (depends on cookbook-2)

load cookbook-1 libraries (load any time since it has no dependencies)  
 load cookbook-2 libraries (since they depend on cookbook-1 libraries)  
 load cookbook-3 libraries (since they depend on cookbook-2 libraries)

Or am I completely missing something and there is already a way to do
this that isn't documented here?
