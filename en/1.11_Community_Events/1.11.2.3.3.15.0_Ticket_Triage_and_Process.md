Ticket Triage and Process
=========================

  

### Session Title:

**Convener:** Bryan McLellan (btm)

**Participants:** Dan DeLeo (kallistec), Marc Paradise, Joshua Timberman
(jtimberman), Tim Smith, Charles J, Brett Weaver, Capen Brinkle, Sean
Escriva, Justin Kolberg, Scott Likens, Tommy Bishop, Jeremy Bingham

#### Summary of discussions:

Everyone expressed being pleased with the improvements in the process
over the last year. We talked about the path that different individuals
had followed to become involved in the project; how they got there and
what information they encountered. Some users found the CLA page, but
not the ticket tracker or 'How to Contribute' page, and others found the
ticket tracker but not the wiki page by way of search. There were many
suggestions for ways to improve the process for new users, which are
outlined and captured below:

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   Improving the 'Introduction' paragraph on
    [http://tickets.opscode.com](http://tickets.opscode.com) - **done**
-   Investigate / create a github bot for responding to pull requests
-   Have a launchpad/reportbug type plugin for JIRA to search for
    duplicates when creating bugs
-   Posting internal Opscode ticket triage, merge and release processes
    on the public wiki
-   Expand the How to Contribute page for coding information such as
    style, tests, etc.
-   Create an interface to suggest tickets to new contributors by degree
    of difficulty
-   Update the email the user receives after they complete the CLA
