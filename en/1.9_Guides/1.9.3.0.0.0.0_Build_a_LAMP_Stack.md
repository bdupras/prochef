Build a LAMP Stack
==================

#### Build a PHP application stack using Chef cookbooks available from the [Cookbooks Community Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) and Hosted Chef.

The Walkthrough Guide assumes you followed the [Fast Start
Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide") and have Chef
installed and working with the Hosted Chef platform.

**At the end of this guide, you'll have four total Ubuntu 10.04 systems
running in Amazon EC2.**

-   1 haproxy load balancer.
-   2 Apache2 web servers running `mod_php`.
-   1 MySQL database server.

If you don't already have an account with Amazon AWS, go to [Amazon Web
Sevices](http://aws.amazon.com/) and click "Sign up". You'll need the
access and secret access key credentials from the sign-up later.

  
 The PHP application used in this guide is [MediaWiki
1.18alpha](http://mediawiki.org), which powers everyone's favorite
encyclopedia [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.com).

We're going to reuse a number of cookbooks from the [Cookbooks Community
Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com/) to build the environment. For
example, the source code lives in **git**, so that cookbook will ensure
Git is available. The load balancer is **haproxy** because it is very
simple to deploy and configure, and we use a recipe that automatically
discovers the PHP application systems. The heavy lifting is handled by
recipes in the **application** and **database** cookbooks.

The **application** cookbook will perform the following steps:

-   create an application specific virtualenv
-   install required packages and pears for the project
-   set up the deployment scaffolding
-   creates LocalSettings.php file with the database connection
    information if required
-   performs a revision-based deploy
-   install Apache2 and mod\_php
-   create an application specific virtual host configuration file.

We are also following the recommended pattern of creating a cookbook
named after the application that is being deployed which contains
application specific setup and configurations. In this case, the
**mediawiki** cookbook contains a recipe that will be used for
bootstrapping our database. It also contains the template that will be
used to render our `LocalSettings.php` file.

on the identified platform(s). Opscode has not researched and does not
support alternative steps that may lead to successful completion on
other platforms. Platform(s) supported by this guide may change over

The AWS *ami-7000f019* mentioned in this section is not searchable in
AWS region that is not us-east-1, which will **break** "knife ec2 create
server" commands (if using AWS region other than us-east-1), if one
follow this guide and do "cut and paste" from this doc. One should find
valid ubuntu supplied ami from site like
[http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/](http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/) or within
AWS ami repo.
