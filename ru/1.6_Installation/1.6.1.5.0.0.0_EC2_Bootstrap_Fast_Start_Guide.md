##### This installation guide describes how to get up and running with Chef as quickly as possible, and will walk you through adding a client node on Amazon's EC2 to your organization in Hosted Chef.

* * * * *

  

###### You can run your own Chef Server, but for this guide we will use Hosted Chef as the Chef Server, so you don't have to set one up.

-   *Clients* are able to run chef-client, but will be unable to
    download, edit, and upload recipes with knife.
-   *Management Workstations* are able to download, edit and upload
    recipes, and can be configured to work as clients as well so they
    can run chef-client.

You can find directions for setting up workstations in the Fast Start
Guides:
