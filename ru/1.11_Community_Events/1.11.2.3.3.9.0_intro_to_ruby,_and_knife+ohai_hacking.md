=====================================

  

### Session Title:

**Convener:** Kurt Yoder, Greg Albrecht  
**Participants:**

#### Summary of discussions:

(there was a pen-written description of this that was turned in, I hope
it still makes it into the wiki)  
 breaking code into libraries  
 applying unit tests against those libraries

-   Always use local Error names (custom exception handlers)
-   Ruby unit testing is very similar to Python unit testing
-   Lack of intrudcutary documentation on Opscode wiki
-   extend @node to more gracefully handle missing nested attributes
-   should have a comprehensive document on @node capabilities

-   Books:
    -   Ruby Kaatas
    -   The well grounded Rubyist

-   test run : execute the .rb
-   ruby-style-guide as an introduction to ruby
-   abstracting libraries to makn them more testable
-   chef definitions are depricated
-   built-in documentatino
-   monkey-patching chef patches without having to do a complete upgrade

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   beginner ruby documentation in Opscode wiki
-   "Ruby on training Wheels"
