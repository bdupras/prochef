#### Summary of discussions:

The discussion touched on a number of common cookbook patterns, but
didn't get to the point where the contents of a "style guide" were
discussed or enumerated.

#### Discussion notes:

**Misc criteria for usability of 'library-style' cookbooks**

-   Easily shareable
-   Useful to others
-   Environment aware
-   LWRPs are very good
-   Can make some reasonable assumptions
-   Configuration items as attributes
-   Ability to easily swap in new templates - usually a good idea

**Plugins**

-   No way to do this right now, but not a very difficult implementation
-   Ability to subclass built-in resources and other LWRPs in an LWRP
-   Plugins as a way to create hook points/callbacks
-   Cookbooks can be more generic and defer specific implementation to
    plugins (e.g. database replication strategy)
-   Related: All resources should have pre/post hooks

**@node vs passed in variables in templates?**

-   Not resolved, some contend that @node should never be used as it's
    dangerous and has potential for side-effects
-   Passed in variables are a way for the cookbook author to define an
    api into the template

**Miscellaneous points discussed**

-   Attribute references should be strings (node['attribute']) - all
    other methods are discouraged and deprecated
-   Dividing line on what should and should not be an LWRP is fuzzy -
    this could use some fleshing out by someone
-   IP addresses: first interface vs second?, cloud IPs or not? This
    needs some kindof helper
-   Platform case statements are a repeated complaint, no good solution
    at this point
-   Direction on how to properly architect a cookbook, so that internal
    data is stolred separately from core cookbook files that might be
    re-shared upstream.

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

Opscode has begun work on a [Cookbook Style Guide
Draft](Cookbook%20Style%20Guide%20Draft.html "Cookbook Style Guide Draft")
