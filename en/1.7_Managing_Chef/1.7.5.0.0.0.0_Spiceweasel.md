===========

#### Spiceweasel is a command-line tool for batch loading Chef infrastructure.

#### It provides a simple syntax in either JSON or YAML for describing and deploying infrastructure in order with the Chef command-line tool [Knife](Knife.html "Knife").

#### Please note, Spiceweasel is not an "official Chef tool", but it is developed by Opscode team member [Matt Ray](http://community.opscode.com/users/mray).

  

Requirements
------------

-   Spiceweasel currently depends on knife to run commands for it.
    Infrastructure files must either end in .json or .yml to be
    processed.
-   It is written with Chef 0.9.12 and the 0.10.x series and supports
    cookbooks, environments, roles, data bags and nodes.
-   Also, as Spiceweasel is not an "official Chef tool", *it is not
    supported for Hosted Chef customers*.

Installation
------------

The source code is available [on
github](https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel), but Spiceweasel is
distributed and installable as a gem.

    gem install spiceweasel

Syntax
------

The syntax for the spiceweasel file may be either JSON or YAML format of
Chef primitives describing what is to be instantiated. Below are 2
examples describing the same infrastructure.

**OpenStack Swift, Chef and SpiceWeasel**  
  
 Our friends at [Voxel](https://www.voxel.net/) put together two great
blog posts on the use of
[OpenStack](Deploying%20OpenStack%20with%20Chef.html "Deploying OpenStack with Chef"),
Chef, and Spiceweasel to automate the deployment, configuration and
management of their infrastructure.

Read **[Part
One](https://www.voxel.net/blog/2011/05/openstack-swift-chef-and-spiceweasel-part-1-0)**,
and **[Part
Two](https://www.voxel.net/blog/2011/07/cooking-openstack-swift-chef-and-spiceweasel-part-2)**,
and love the weasel.

I think you should not embed the knife options as a single line in the
node object, but instead use a hash where the keys are the full text
names of the options as a child of nodes. You should also have the
run\_list as one of the options and have the actual roles and recipes as
an array under the run\_list key:

**Example node**

    {
        "ec2":
        {
        "quantity": 3,
        "node-name": "my_big_server",
        "run_list": 
          [
            "role[webserver]",
            "recipe[mysql::client]",
          ],
        "ssh_key": "mray",
        "identity-file": "~/.ssh/mray.pem",
        "ssh-user": "ubuntu",
        "groups": "default",
        "image": "ami-7000f019",
        "flavor": "m1.small"
        }
    }

You could also have a special key for passing knife options as you are
doing now as a fall back/compatability option.

If you are going to have the mechanism to specify the quantity of the
nodes to generate (which is not passed to the knife command, but it is
used to determine how many times to run the command), it should be an
explicit key/option.

It should also take the node-name and append a number to the node-name
that is the index of the loop.

I would suggest adding another parameter that is also not passed to
knife but is used as an offset for the number appended to the node-name.
So if you add nodes of the same basename you can explicitly specify the
starting number of the next batch of nodes of the same basename.

You can also make an option to append the environment to the name or
some other string to further namespace node-names if need be.

I'm not sure I want to introduce additional complexity to the yaml and
json files for Spiceweasel. By keeping the syntax restricted and simple,
it's easier to share and understand the files. By adding a hash of all
the available options, the format of the files will greatly change,
introducing a lot more verbosity to the file. I prefer having the list
of CLI options because in my opinion it encourages looking those up and
becoming more familiar with knife, rather than introducing another layer
of abstraction.

Of course Spiceweasel is free to fork, so perhaps if you implement it
and make it an additional option we can see how that looks, but I don't
believe I want to add that myself.

Formatting of \`example.yml\` is messed up. Can the original author post
something correct?
