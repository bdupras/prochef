Ohai Installation and Use
=========================

  

![image](../attachments/2457791/20840688.jpg)

  

Opscode distributes Ohai as a Gem, available from [http://rubygems.org/](http://rubygems.org/gems/ohai)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *It is a requirement for Chef, so if you have Chef installed, you have Ohai.*

### If you would like to install Ohai separately, for testing or development, read on.

**If you're running Windows, see [Installing Ohai on
Windows](Installing%20Ohai%20on%20Windows.html "Installing Ohai on Windows")
for more information.**   

Install Gem
===========

**Ohai Version Dependencies**

-   Use of Ohai Version 0.6.x, requires the use of Chef version 0.9.x or
    greater.

-   Chef version 0.10 requires Ohai Version 0.6.x or greater, and will
    not function with earlier versions.

Add Rubygems.org's gem server to your local sources.

**Update Gem Sources**

    sudo gem source -a http://rubygems.org

Install the Gem.

**Install Ohai**

    sudo gem install ohai

This will also install Ohai's dependency gems, json, extlib and systemu.

Install from Git
================

We use GitHub for sharing our source code, so to install the source from
Git:

**clone git repository**

    git clone git://github.com/opscode/ohai.git

Install the gem with rake.

**rake install**

    rake install

See the README.rdoc included in the repository (or on the [GitHub
page](http://github.com/opscode/ohai/tree/master)) for more about Ohai
development. Also read [about contributing to Opscode
projects](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute")

Using Ohai
==========

-   ##### Node data from ohai is provided to Chef via an object named `node`.

    When used with Chef, Ohai JSON output is reported back via
    ["automatic" node
    attributes](Automatic%20Attributes.html "Automatic Attributes") to
    update the node object on the chef-server.

-   ##### Ohai can also be run outside of Chef, so you can query your system for various data.

    When run standalone, Ohai will print out a JSON data blob for all
    the known data about your system.

-   ##### Use as a Library

    You can use Ohai as a library within a ruby program or script.
