Architecture
============

  

### Clients

##### Chef includes several clients with the distribution:

-   [**Chef Solo:**](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo") is a client
    application that works entirely from on-disk data, and is a
    light-weight alternative to a full client-server configuration.
-   [**Chef Client:**](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") is the client
    application that works with a [Chef
    Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") to persist data and
    download cookbooks. Chef Clients can also take advantage of Chef
    Server's search abilities to dynamically integrate your applications
    with the rest of your infrastructure.
-   [**Knife:**](Knife.html "Knife") is the command line interface to
    Chef. Knife is primarily used to interact with the Chef Server API,
    and it can be used for local [Chef
    Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository") maintenance.
-   [**Shef:**](Shef.html "Shef") is the interactive Chef shell. Shef
    allows you to write, run, and debug recipes interactively and also
    provides a programmatic interface for viewing and editing data on
    your Chef Server.

  

### Server Architecture

##### The Chef Server that the Chef Client interacts with is either:

###### Hosted Chef

-   [Hosted Chef](Hosted%20Chef.html "Hosted Chef") customers do not
    need to manage their Chef Server, as that is done for them by
    [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/).
-   If you are a Hosted Chef Customer and have a question, please
    contact [support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com).

###### Private Chef

-   Private Chef customers should refer to their separate Private Chef
    Administration Documention for the Private Chef Server.
-   If you are a Private Chef Customer and have a question, please
    contact [support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com).

###### Open Source Chef Server

-   An Open Source Chef Server is comprised of the following components:
    -   [**Chef Server:**](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") services
        HTTP API requests from the Web UI, nodes, and other clients (see
        above).
    -   [**Chef Server Web
        UI:**](Chef%20Server.html#ChefServer-ChefServerWebUserInterface)
        the web-based management console for the Chef Server. It manages
        your infrastructure by making API calls to Chef Server.
    -   [**CouchDB:**](http://couchdb.apache.org/) the primary data
        store for a Chef server.
    -   [**RabbitMQ:**](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) stores and then
        forwards data from Chef Server to the Chef Solr Indexer. It acts
        as a buffer for cases when high write loads temporarily exceed
        the ability of the Chef Solr Indexer to update the search index.
    -   [**Chef Solr
        Indexer:**](Chef%20Indexer.html#ChefIndexer-ChefIndexerChefSolrIndexer)
        flattens and expands data to enhance searchability, then writes
        the data to Chef Solr.
    -   [**Chef
        Solr:**](Chef%20Indexer.html#ChefIndexer-ChefIndexerChefSolr) a
        thin wrapper around the [Apache Solr search
        engine](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). Chef Solr allows you to
        find your way around your infrastructure by querying its
        metadata.
