Migrating changes from the old monolithic cookbooks repo
========================================================

If you want to export patches from your fork of the old cookbooks
repository for one of the new ones, you can use git format-patch and git
apply. For example, if you have the two most recent commits and want to
export those as a patch:

    opscode/cookbooks $ git format-patch --stdout --no-prefix HEAD~2 > ../cookbook-patches/COOK-XYZ-CBNAME.patch
    opscode-cookbooks/CBNAME$ git apply --stat ../cookbook-patches/COOK-XYZ-CBNAME.patch
    opscode-cookbooks/CBNAME$ git apply --check ../cookbook-patches/COOK-XYZ-CBNAME.patch
    opscode-cookbooks/CBNAME$ git am < ../cookbook-patches/COOK-XYZ-CBNAME.patch

It is important to use git apply --check to see if the patch will apply
cleanly.

We'll be working on getting pull requests in the old repository handled.
If you have an open pull request there, it would be totally awesome if
you can reapply your patch to a fork of the new repository for the
cookbook and submit a pull request for it. Also make sure that you have
updated the appropriate ticket in JIRA with the link for the new pull
request.
