Overview
========

### Environments in Chef provide a mechanism for managing different environments such as production, staging, development, and testing, etc with one Chef setup (or one organization on Hosted Chef).   
  
 With environments, you can specify per environment run lists in roles, per environment [cookbook versions](Version%20Constraints.html "Version Constraints"), and environment attributes.

The \_default Environment
=========================

**When you first create an organization, only one environment will be
setup and it will be named the "\_default" environment.** You can use
this environment for viewing, but editing is restricted so you can't
modify it. If you try to, you will get an error similar to this:

    ERROR: Method Not Allowed 
    Response: Merb::ControllerExceptions::MethodNotAllowed

You'll want to create a new environment if you want to modify it, such
as setting the attributes.

Creating Environments
=====================

**You can create environments in Chef in 5 different ways:**

1.  through the creation of environment files in your chef repository
    (that utilize a ruby DSL, which gets compiled to JSON,)
2.  the creation of the JSON files directly in your chef repository,
3.  through the [Open Source Chef Server Management
    Console](Open%20Source%20Chef%20Server%20Management%20Console.html "Open Source Chef Server Management Console"),
4.  with [Knife](Knife.html "Knife"), or
5.  through the [REST API](Server%20API.html "Server API").

We will cover each option here. When an environment exists, you can set
a node to be in the environment using the node's chef\_environment
method. The remaining sections of this article will show the details of
the work-flow.

It wasn't obvious from this page that you can upload the Ruby
environment file with the command:  
`knife environment from file environments/dev.rb`

As far as I can tell, rake install will not upload environment files. At
least a rake --dry-run doesn't seem to and I can't find any reference to
environments in the chef-0.10.0.rc.1 chef\_repo.rake file.

Am I missing something?

It would be nice to have rake upload\_environments and
upload\_environment to match the databag and cookbook patterns

It would be really helpful if the section named, "Adding Environment to
Nodes" was a bit more explicit in how to add these things. What is the
syntax required for specifying an environment in the \~/.chef/knife.rb
file?

Hi,

With the new version of chef, I try to do this.

For example: knife cookbook upload tcloudIaaSupdate -E tcloud.

When I press Enter show next error:  
 Uploading tcloudIaaSupdate 0.0.2  
 ERROR: TypeError: wrong argument type Hash (expected Data)

After that I go to the chef-server web and I cannot see that this
version its upload.

What is the problem?

Best Regards,  
 Javier

Hi Javier,

Please see [Support](Support.html "Support") and seek assistance through
[IRC](IRC.html "IRC"), or the [Chef mailing
list](http://lists.opscode.com/). (Or through
[help.opscode.com](http://help.opscode.com) if you are a Platform
customer.) You'll likely need to provide info re: your OS Platform and
version, and what version of Chef and Ruby and RubyGems you are using -
as that error could have a number of causes.

I had the same error. I was using Ubuntu 11.4 and chef-client 10.  
 Downdagrading chef to 9.16 seemed to be a quickfix for me. I realize
that is not a viable solution, but being in the learning chef phaze i
needed a fast solution

Is it possible to specify an environment in the first-boot.json file?

I'm trying to auto-provision servers with an environment.

Alternately, is there a better way to make per environment variables?   
 I want variables to apply to groups of machines.   
 I'm using roles to control my webservers, then environments to define
variables for dev/production. I don't want to version cookbooks for one
attribute when I can use the defaults in the environment.  
 Am I going about this the wrong way?
