#### These directions explain how to install Chef on a node running OS X via Rubygems. [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") are hosts whose configuration you want to manage using Chef.

**In general, installing chef-client on a node includes:**

-   Installing Ruby and Other Dependencies
-   Installing Chef
-   Configuring Chef

Install XCode
-------------

Install XCode from your OS X installation media or by downloading and
installing it from
[http://developer.apple.com/xcode/](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

You must also install the additional Xcode command line tools if this
was not done so. After Xcode installs, launch it, and go: Xcode -\>
Preferences -\> Downloads -\> Install (command line tools)

Install Ruby
------------

Ruby 1.8.7 or better is required to run Chef. Ruby is already installed
in recent versions of OS X. If you do not have Ruby installed or if your
version of Ruby is too old, you can install Ruby using the information
provided at
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

Install RubyGems from Source
----------------------------

We prefer to install RubyGems from source rather than use the
OS-provided version (if any), as it is cross platform, so we know what
to expect.

**Install RubyGems**

Install Chef Gem
----------------

To install Chef and its dependencies, run the following code:

**Install Chef**

-   If you are installing Chef to use chef-client, proceed below.
-   If you are installing Chef-solo as a means of installing Chef
    Server, return to [Installing Chef Server using Chef
    Solo](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20using%20Chef%20Solo.html "Installing Chef Server using Chef Solo").
-   If you wish to use Chef-solo as your primary Chef client, see [Chef
    Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo").

Configure chef-client
---------------------

The initial configuration of a chef-client requires a `client.rb`
configuration file and a `validation.pem` file to be placed in
`/etc/chef`. At a minimum `client.rb` must contain the configuration
settings necessary for chef-client to communicate with chef-server.
`validation.pem` is the permission certificate for your validator
client. This API client is used on the first-run of chef-client and is
used to create a new API client for the node. To create these we do the
following:

1.  Create `/etc/chef`:
2.  Create `client.rb` and `validation.pem`:   
      
    **If you have a properly configured workstation**, you should be
    able to run the following command from your workstation's chef
    repository

    This will place `client.rb` and `validation.pem` in your current
    working directory on your chef workstation. You can then use `scp`
    or another method to move both files into `/etc/chef` on the node
    you are configuring.   
      
    **If you do not have a configured workstation**, you should create a
    minimal `/etc/chef/client.rb`. If you are using your own chef-server
    `client.rb` should look as follows (substituting the correct address
    of your chef server):

    **client.rb**

    If you are using Hosted Chef, `client.rb` should look as follows
    (with ORGNAME replaced with your Organization Short Name}}:

    **client.rb for Hosted Chef**

      
      
    **Your `validation.pem` can be downloaded from your chef-server if
    you are running your own chef-server. On your Chef Server,
    `validation.pem` should be in `/etc/chef/`. Users of Hosted Chef can
    find their validator client's key from the [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Managing%20Organizations%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Organizations with the Hosted Chef Management Console").
    Note that if you are using Hosted Chef, your key is named
    `ORGNAME-validator.pem`.**

Chef client has a number of configuration settings that do not appear
above. See [Chef Configuration
Settings](Chef%20Configuration%20Settings.html "Chef Configuration Settings")
for further details.
