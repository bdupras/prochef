#### Summary of discussions:

-   [Nathaniel Eliot](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/~temujin9):
    Overview of what cluster\_chef provides on top of chef
-   Discussion on tools for orchestrating large clusters
    -   [cluster\_chef](https://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef) &
        rundeck
    -   dominodes: databag-based locking mechanism (security issue:
        nodes require write on all databags)
    -   chef-solo + push mechanism
    -   crowbar: has its own internal orchestration
    -   ruote: ruby orchestration library
    -   nanite: messaging bus
    -   rightscale: has a tool ("remote recipe"?) for invoking single
        recipes on a target node

-   Monitoring tools
    -   zabbix - monitoring
    -   sensu - monitoring framework from Sonia, using Rabbit MQ
    -   nagios - perpetual monitoring standard

-   PeterN: use case of launching a cluster, use case for orchestration
    -   Standard web app, discussing options for orchestration. Rundeck
        will be used with cluster\_chef
    -   Standard stack of rabbitmq, web apps, and nginx needing to be
        completed in order and asap
    -   Learned: rightscale provides a platform that offers
        orchestration. They are adding chef support (maybe done already?
        I'm not clear on this)
    -   Also there is a non-server-based discovery protocol that can be
        used for orchestration called dominodes (I'm not sure how this
        works - in the end I see things like
        [https://github.com/websterclay/chef-dominodes](https://github.com/websterclay/chef-dominodes)
        which uses a databag as the lock? I guess dominodes facilitates
        intra-node communication).
    -   Desired use cases:
        -   Spin lock (wait\_for\_foo "foo\_name" so that only one node
            is ever doing "foo\_name" in a cluster)
        -   event coordination (wait\_until\_foo "foo\_happened" so that
            when a resource becomes available, nodes that need it can
            use it)
        -   Remote execution (run\_then\_activate "foo\_nodes" where
            after a node runs an action, either it directly, or through
            a chef server, can invoke a resource or a chef run on the
            nodes that comprise "foo\_nodes").

    -   Takeaway: chef needs to provide orchestration syntax. There are
        at least 3 use cases. The use cases may be orthogonal, but some
        API decisions need to be made and these need to be approached.
        It would be preferred if the chef server could do this instead
        of just cooperating with an outside infrastructure (in my
        opinion)

#### Other stack tools mentioned:

-   elastic search
-   hadoop
-   hbase
-   goliath
-   unicorn
-   apistack
-   mongo
-   rails
-   noah - zookeeper - doozer (doozerd?)
-   chef plugin for Run Deck
-   mcollective

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   Desired feature: ability to run a single recipe (+ dependencies?) on
    a node, without fouling up run-list or node data
