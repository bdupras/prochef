Overview
--------

##### [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") are [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") data such as the IP address, hostname, loaded kernel modules, version of programming languages available on the system and more. New attributes can be dynamically added to the node in a variety of ways.  
  
 During the [Chef run](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run"), the [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") saves these node attributes on the [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") where they are indexed for [Search](Search.html "Search"). When the [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") runs again, it will retrieve the attributes that were saved previously and merge in attributes based on the priority rules described below.

Setting Attributes
------------------

Attributes may be set on the node from the following objects
