#### Summary of discussions:

**Chef installation**: the Chef Installer MSI is a highly desired
feature that will land soon. People would like to provide base config
information at install time: certificate, validator name, etc.

**Needed Windows features**: we talked for a bit about the biggest pain
points, and the things people do most often that could use automation:

-   Zipfiles
-   Windows patch installs
-   Cron
-   Domain Switching / Joining, Moving to an Organizational Unit
-   DNS Record Updates
-   User and Group Memberships on domains
-   Power Options, (Control Panel?)
-   MSI Installs
-   File Shares: easy to do with "net share", a resource may be
    worthwhile with security attributes though
-   Security Auditing: group was like "eh, maybe"

**Security mixin**: we covered the upcoming rights attributes for files
and directories. The fact that :write implies :read seemed right to
people. There was a desire to append rights to a file (and not remove
them) was there. The ability to clear or remove rights from a file was
also desired.

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

The above features need to get prioritized and written by people.
