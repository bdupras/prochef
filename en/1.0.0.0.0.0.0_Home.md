Welcome to the Chef Wiki!
=========================

### Chef is a systems integration framework, built to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.

  

#### With Chef, you can:

-   Manage your servers by writing code, not by running commands. (via
    [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks"))
-   Integrate tightly with your applications, databases, LDAP
    directories, and more. (via [Libraries](Libraries.html "Libraries"))
-   Easily configure applications that require knowledge about your
    entire infrastructure ("What systems are running my application?"
    "What is the current master database server?") (via
    [Search](Search.html "Search"))
-   Create perfect clones of QA environments, pre-production
    environments, partner preview environments and more. (via
    [Environments](Environments.html "Environments"))

Once automated, you hold a blueprint for your infrastructure, enabling
you to build, or rebuild, automatically in minutes or hours – not weeks
or months. Better still, when you take those environments live and
reality intrudes - which, trust us, it will - Chef gives you endless
flexibility to adapt on the fly.

#### It works the way you want it to:

We provide the building blocks that help you to accomplish your goals.
At the end of the day, it's about your infrastructure being easy to
manage. Chef provides the horse-power to get you to where you need to be
- it doesn't start out telling you where you should be going.
