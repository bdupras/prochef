##### This document is focused on users who wish to get the latest development version of Chef installed for testing and development, or for the latest and greatest features that haven't been [officially released](Release%20Notes.html "Release Notes") yet.

* * * * *

  

###### Developers who wish to [contribute](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute") to the project are encouraged to read the README.rdoc in the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/opscode/chef).

###### Each released version of Chef is tagged in the Git Repository. You can work with a previous version's code by checking out the tag.

**Version Numbering Style**  
We follow Linux kernel-style versioning. If the patch-level version is
odd, it's a 'dev' release, as installing from HEAD is certainly 'dev'.

Requirements
============

First, you'll want to designate a system for development and deployment.
This is the place where you'll clone the repository and create the gems.
It can be your local workstation, or it can be the [Chef
Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") itself.

-   Git - the source is on GitHub, so you'll need to have Git installed
    for your platform.
-   RubyGems - we have Rake tasks for generating and installing the
    gems, and these instructions should work anywhere with RubyGems. We
    recommend installing RubyGems from source.
-   Rake - we like Rake, and use it liberally, install the `rake` gem.
-   RSpec - we do specs in rspec, install the `rspec` gem v 1.3.1.
    v2.0.0 does not work with our current testsuite.
-   Cucumber - we do feature tests with cucumber, install the `cucumber`
    gem.
-   Gemcutter and Jeweler - we use jeweler for gemspec generation and
    may want to push to gemcutter, install these gems.

When installing the gems that are built from these instructions and
using the [Installing Chef Server using Chef
Solo](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20using%20Chef%20Solo.html "Installing Chef Server using Chef Solo")
on [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") or [Chef
Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") systems, other dependencies
are handled as well such as CouchDB, RabbitMQ and Java.

  
 You can also install the these for a [Chef Server
manually](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20Manually.html "Installing Chef Server Manually").

**Install RubyGem Development Requirements**

    gem install rspec rake cucumber jeweler gemcutter

  
 Some other gems are required to build the gems, but are automatically
installed when we use `rake install`
[below](#InstallingCheffromHEAD-InstallingtheGems). If you want to have
them available first:

**Install Additional Gem Building Requirements**

    gem install merb-core merb-slices merb-assets merb-helpers merb-haml moneta bunny uuidtools

**Bring behaviour-driven development to infrastructure as code**  
  
[![image](../attachments/thumbnails/1180194/14057501)](http://wiki.opscode.com/download../attachments/1180194/cat.gif)  
 Community member [Stephen Nelson-Smith](http://agilesysadmin.net/) has
written **[Test-Driven Infrastructure with
Chef](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020042)**.

He demonstrates a radical approach to developing web infrastructure that
combines the powerful Chef configuration management framework with
Cucumber, the leading Behavior-driven development (BDD) tool.

Learn how developing code test-first allows you to make significant
changes without the fear of unexpected side effects.

Looks like gemcutter jeweler are also prerequisites to do a rake install
for the server. Got the following message:

    rake install
    (in /Users/rberger/workspace/Chef/rberger-chef/chef-solr)
    Jeweler (or a dependency) not available. Install it from gemcutter with: sudo gem install gemcutter jeweler
    rake aborted!
    Don't know how to build task 'install'

So before you do the rake install for the server:

    sudo gem install gemcutter jeweler

As of 2010-11-27 mixlib requires 'spec/rake/spectask' in some Rakefiles,
which is not available in rspec 2 anymore.

So if you get any errors about rake being unable to load that file, try
installing rspec like this:

    gem install --version '<2' rspec
