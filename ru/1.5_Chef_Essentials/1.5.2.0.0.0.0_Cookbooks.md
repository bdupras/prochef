### Cookbooks are the fundamental units of distribution in Chef. They encapsulate all the resources you need to automate your infrastructure and are easily sharable with other Chef users.

  

  
  

What's in a Cookbook?
=====================

**Cookbooks contain:**

-   **[Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes")** that are values on
    [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") to set default values used elsewhere in
    the cookbook.
-   **[Definitions](Definitions.html "Definitions")** that allow you to
    create reusable collections of one or more
    [Resources](Resources.html "Resources").
-   **[File
    Distribution](File%20Distribution.html "File Distribution")** that
    are transferred to your Chef-administered machines via [Cookbook
    File](Resources.html#Resources-CookbookFile) resource.
-   **[Libraries](Libraries.html "Libraries")** that extend Chef or
    provide helpers with Ruby code.
-   **[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes")** that specify
    [Resources](Resources.html "Resources") to manage, in the order they
    should be managed.
-   **[Lightweight Resources and Providers
    (LWRP)](Lightweight%20Resources%20and%20Providers%20(LWRP).html "Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP)")**
    that allow you to create your own custom resources and providers.
-   **[Templates](Templates.html "Templates")** that are rendered on
    Chef-configured machines with your dynamically substituted values.
    Think config files on steroids, then read [ERB
    templates](Resources.html#Resources-Template).
-   **[Metadata](Metadata.html "Metadata")** that tells Chef about your
    recipes, including dependencies, [version
    constraints](Version%20Constraints.html "Version Constraints"),
    supported platforms and more.

Each of these components is a directory or file. An example cookbook
directory after running the `cookbook create` [knife
command](Chef%20Repository.html#ChefRepository-cookbooks):

**Cookbook Contents**

    attributes/
    definitions/
    files/
    libraries/
    metadata.rb
    providers/
    README.rdoc
    recipes/
    resources/
    templates/

You develop cookbooks on your local system in the [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository"), in the
`cookbooks/` sub-directory.

How do I work with cookbooks?
=============================

We recommend you develop cookbooks in the **[Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository")**. You can create
your own cookbooks, or you can download other people's shared cookbooks.

Then, you can upload your cookbooks to your Chef Server or to the
[Opscode Community Cookbooks site](http://community.opscode.com/)
through **[Managing Cookbooks With
Knife](Managing%20Cookbooks%20With%20Knife.html "Managing Cookbooks With Knife")**.

How do I create a new Cookbook?
===============================

You can create a new cookbook in your [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository") `cookbooks/`
sub-directory with
[Knife](Chef%20Repository.html#ChefRepository-cookbooks).

    % knife cookbook create MYCOOKBOOK
    ** Creating cookbook MYCOOKBOOK
    ** Creating README for cookbook: MYCOOKBOOK
    ** Creating metadata for cookbook: MYCOOKBOOK

Then start editing the various components, such as the default recipe,
as needed. (See **[Guide to Creating A Cookbook and Writing A
Recipe](Guide%20to%20Creating%20A%20Cookbook%20and%20Writing%20A%20Recipe.html "Guide to Creating A Cookbook and Writing A Recipe")**
for an additional examples.)

**Nagios and Chef at Fotopedia**

[Fotopedia](http://www.fotopedia.com) uses Chef in the management of
their infrastructure. Among many other things, Chef generates the Nagios
configuration for all their services. Their Fotopedia Labs blog entry:
**[Nagios and Chef at
Fotopedia](http://code.fotopedia.com/2011/08/nagios-and-chef-at-fotopedia.html)**
includes extensive detail on the use of recipes, roles, ruby blocks,
helpers and other Chef components - all within their Nagios Cookbook.

**Guide to Writing Cookbooks by Joshua Timberman**

Opscode team member Joshua Timberman posted a guide to writing cookbooks

The git cloning doesn't allow clone repository to existed directory.
Then, how can I get pre-made cookbooks into my cookbooks directory?

Sounds like you're using the [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository"), simply remove the
`cookbooks/` directory and then you can clone `opscode/cookbooks` from
GitHub.

I already organized chef-repo in our own git server. So I did like
below:

cd \~/chef-repo  
 git rm -r cookbooks  
 git commit -m "Delete cookbooks directory to use Opscode pre-made
cookbooks"  
 git submodule add git://github.com/opscode/cookbooks.git ./cookbooks  
 git add .gitmodules cookbooks/  
 git commit -m "Import Opscode pre-made cookbooks"

Is it reasonable(Sorry, I'm a newbie of chef and git)?

Using Git submodules is perfectly ok. I know there's some others that
use that method as well. It keeps your version consistent too, since its
tied a commit.
