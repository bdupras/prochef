### The Management Console is a web interface for the Chef Server.  
  
 Many components can be managed through the console including users, nodes, roles, cookbooks, data bags, and API clients. Search can also be done on the console.

###### Most of these operations can also be completed by command line with [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") as well.

*The Management Console will look and operate differently based upon the
flavor of Chef you are using.*
