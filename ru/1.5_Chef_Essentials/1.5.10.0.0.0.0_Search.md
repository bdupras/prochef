Overview
========

#### Search is a feature of the [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") that allows you to use a full-text search engine (based on [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)) to query information about your infrastructure and applications.

#### Searches are built by the Chef Server, and allow you to query arbitrary data about your infrastructure. You can utilize this service via [search calls in a recipe](#Search-UsingSearchInRecipes) or the `knife search` command.

##### Most data that Chef stores is automatically indexed in Solr including [Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags"), [API Clients](API%20Clients.html "API Clients"), [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes"), and [Roles](Roles.html "Roles").

Search Index Names
==================

Chef's built-in types are indexed in the following search indexes (don't
worry about the search syntax for now):

Data Type

Index Name

Example Knife Search

[Roles](Roles.html "Roles")

role

`knife search role "name:production*"`

[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes")

node

`knife search node "name:app*"`

[API Clients](API%20Clients.html "API Clients")

client

`knife search client "name:c*"`

[Environments](Environments.html "Environments")

environment

`knife search environment "``:``"`

Data bags are indexed by the data bag's name. For example, to search for
items in a data bag named 'bag\_o\_data' in knife, use a query like:

    knife search bag_o_data "arbitrary_key:some_value"

The 'client' index is currently affected by a bug and will return
incorrect results.

Query Syntax
============

Queries have the form "field:search\_pattern" where "field" is a key in
the JSON description of the objects being searched. The search pattern
supports exact, wildcard, range, or fuzzy matching. The field name has
limited support for wildcard matching.

***Note:*** Both the field and search pattern is case sensitive.

Field Name Syntax
-----------------

Field names are keys in the JSON description of the object being
searched.

To search in a nested key, for example `dmi / system / product_name`,
insert an underscore "\_" between key names:

    knife search node "dmi_system_product_name:ProLiant*"

Note that wildcard use with nested field has changed between version 0.9
and 0.10. See [Nested Fields](#Search-SearchNestedFields) below for
details.

### Discovering Key Names

The definitive list of search keys are the keys in the JSON description
of the object being searched. To see the keys available when searching
nodes:

    knife node show staging -Fj | less

This command will open a full JSON description of the node "staging" in
the pager `less`. Similarly `knife data bag show`, `knife client show`,
and `knife role show` can be used to find keys available for their
respective objects. The json keys are the definitive search keys to be
used in any search context (knife, recipe, Hosted Chef, etc).

### Wildcard Matching for Field Names

The field name also has limited support for wildcard matching. Both the
"\*" and "?" wildcards (see below) can be used within a field name;
however, they cannot be the first character of the field name. For
example, the following are valid queries:

    knife search node 'platfo*:ubuntu'
    knife search node 'platfor?:ubuntu'

Community member [Christian
Paredes](http://community.opscode.com/users/cparedes) put together a
blog post on **[using Search in
Recipes](http://redbluemagenta.com/2010/12/02/chef-as-a-system-integration-tool/)**
to gather information on the database nodes and then to take action
based upon that defined criteria.
