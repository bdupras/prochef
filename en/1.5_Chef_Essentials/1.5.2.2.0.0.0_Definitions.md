Definitions
===========

  

**Definitions allow you to create new [Resources](Resources.html "Resources") by stringing together existing resources.**

##### Definitions declarations must be placed in a definitions folder at the root of your cookbook. Do not declare them into a cookbook.

#### 

When to Use Definitions

-   You are repeating a pattern of resources
-   You do not want to send actions directly to this resource - i.e.,
    you never need to notify it
-   You want to pass data from various recipes to one definition, to
    update your /etc/aliases, /etc/sudoers, or something similar, with
    entries from multiple recipes in a single chef run.

  

#### *Definitions aren't resources*

They are replaced by the resources they contain. **You cannot notify a
definition to take an action - you can only notify the resources it
creates**. If you do need to send actions to the resource, you should
look in to creating a new [Provider](Providers.html "Providers").

  
There are three components to a definition:  
 1. The resource name  
 2. The Prototype Parameters  
 3. The Params hash

  
 You start with `define`, followed by the name of the new resource
(`apache_site`). What follows is the Prototype Arguments for the
definition - these are used to set default values for parameters within
the definition.

**Definition and Prototyping**

    define :apache_site, :action => :enable do
      ...
    end

Those parameters are then accessed within your definition via the
`params` hash.   
 The values you specify in the definition are used as defaults in case a
given parameter is not provided when invoking the resource. Since this
is a hash, you don't have to provide a default value for every
parameter; if none is specified, it will be assumed to be `nil`.

**Hey, CGI programmers...**  
The params hash should look familiar to you - it's basically the exact
same model we've been following ever since the CGI.pm days.

  

### Example

This definition file creates a new resource `apache_site`:

**apache\_site Definition**

    define :apache_site, :enable => true do
      include_recipe "apache2"

      if params[:enable]
        execute "a2ensite #{params[:name]}" do
          command "/usr/sbin/a2ensite #{params[:name]}"
          notifies :restart, resources(:service => "apache2")
          not_if do
            ::File.symlink?("#{node[:apache][:dir]}/sites-enabled/#{params[:name]}") or
              ::File.symlink?("#{node[:apache][:dir]}/sites-enabled/000-#{params[:name]}")
          end
          only_if do ::File.exists?("#{node[:apache][:dir]}/sites-available/#{params[:name]}") end
        end
      else
        execute "a2dissite #{params[:name]}" do
          command "/usr/sbin/a2dissite #{params[:name]}"
          notifies :restart, resources(:service => "apache2")
          only_if do ::File.symlink?("#{node[:apache][:dir]}/sites-enabled/#{params[:name]}") end
        end
      end
    end

We utilize it by placing the definition in the
[recipe](Recipes.html "Recipes"):

**apache\_site resource**

    # Enable my_site.conf
    apache_site "my_site.conf" do
      enable true
    end

    # Disable my_site.conf
    apache_site "my_site.conf" do
      enable false
    end

We take the attributes of our new `apache_site` resource, and make them
accessible via the `params` hash. This will be true of any attribute we
set - you do not have to prototype all your parameters. Within the
context of the Chef run, this definition will be replaced by all the
resources you specify within the definition - in the "enabled" case, it
is expanded to:

**The resources created by this definition**

    execute "a2ensite my_site.conf" do
      command "/usr/sbin/a2ensite my_site.conf"
      notifies :restart, resources(:service => "apache2")
      not_if do 
        ::File.symlink?("/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/my_site.conf") or
          ::File.symlink?("/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-my_site.conf")
      end
    end

You can have as many resources in a definition as you want.

### You can also pass data from various recipes to one definition.

Passing data from various recipes to one definition is possible. For
example, you'd like to update your /etc/aliases, /etc/sudoers, or
something similar, with entries from multiple
[recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") in a single chef run. Reopening
resources is the way do this currently. Here's an example
[definition]( "Definitions") for adding email aliases (via Mithrandir on
\#chef):

    define :email_alias, :recipients => [] do
      execute "newaliases" do
        action :nothing
      end

      t = nil
      begin
        t = resources(:template => "/etc/aliases")
      rescue Chef::Exceptions::ResourceNotFound
        t = template "/etc/aliases" do
          source "aliases.erb"
          cookbook "aliases"
          variables({:aliases => {} })
          notifies :run, "execute[newaliases]"
        end
      end

      if not t.variables[:aliases].has_key?(params[:name])
        t.variables[:aliases][params[:name]] = []
      end
      t.variables[:aliases][params[:name]] << [ params[:recipients] ]
    end

  

### Use Case Scenario

*I've two applications to deploy/run using chef on a single node under
the same domain/subdomain. One is a Rails app and another is a Wordpress
blog app. The Rails app will reside as the main app at say
\`example.com\` and the wordpress at \`blog.example.com\`. And lets
assume that I'll be using Apache2 or Nginx as the webserver to handle
the VirtualHost. I can create 2 separate run\_list adding different
roles to it. Later, when I have to add another app on the same domain,
e.g. \`forum.example.com\` on the same node, I can create a separate
run\_list for this. But how do I update/amend the VirtualHost of the
web-server since it's only one per node?*

Definitions are a feature of Chef cookbooks that allow one to create
"macros" for resources so they can be reused. The \`web\_app\`
definition exists in our apache2 cookbook, and can be used like this:

    web_app "blog_site" do
         server_name "blog"
         server_aliases [ "blog.#{node['domain']}", node['fqdn'] ]
         docroot "/srv/www/blog_site"
       end

When Chef processes the recipe containing this, it sees web\_app and
looks to see if it recognizes it as a "resource". It will find it as
loaded from the [Opscode apache2
cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apache2), and then
process the template according to how the definition was written.

It is important to note that definitions aren't actually resources, and
to Chef they are replaced by the resources they contain. They cannot be
signaled directly with a notification, though the contained resources
can.

We also have a (relatively old) [blog
post](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2009/03/31/web-applications-are-a-breeze-with-chef/)
about this specific definition.

  
  
  
  

  

I don't quite get the email\_alias definition here to be honest.  
 1.) why do we execute newaliases at the beginning of this definition ?

2.) my confusion is mostly with the code after it.  
 If I got this right when the email\_alias definition is used like this
in a recipe:

    email_alias "joe" do
      recipients ["frank", "pete", "adam"]
    end

    then it should expand into:

    execute "newaliases" do
        action :nothing
    end

    if not t.variables[:aliases].has_key?(joe)
        t.variables[:aliases][joe] = []
    end
    t.variables[:aliases][joe] << ["frank", "pete", "adam"]

Given that t resource will come either from read in template or from
newly created template. ? I guess what confuses me is the sequence of
the actions in the example code - first we open a resource and THEN we
populate its variables and once those vars are populated we actually
execute the resource ? Do those variables somehow magically get into
that resource and the whole definition eventually expands into the
following ??:

    execute "newaliases" do
        action :nothing
    end

    template "/etc/aliases" do
          source "aliases.erb"
          cookbook "aliases"
          variables({:aliases => {"joe" => ["frank", "pete", "adam"]} })
          notifies :run, "execute[newaliases]"
    end

sorry for my ignorance - Im just a rookie!
