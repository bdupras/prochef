**Participants: Fletcher Nichol, Aaron Bento, Michael Leinartas, Shawn

#### Summary of discussions:

-   Generally Individuals do just enough for their own environment, want
    to encourage people to work together to improve existing cookbooks
    or create new ones
-   Could have some folks port to different platforms
-   Coordinate with the authors of Opscode and other cookbooks to make
    sure we aren't doing redundant efforts
-   Encourage people who have a personal cookbook but need help to get
    it in shape for public release
-   Mix physical and virtual meetups

-   Style guid will be helpful
-   We could give feedback to styleguide
-   Styleguide could be used to judge what cookbooks need updates and
    what to do
-   Create a set of guidelines to decide which cookbooks to update
-   Paramerterize / hooks to allow easy ways to use different package
    managers, from source
-   Break out install and configure recipes
-   Use LWRP and libraries to impove readability and extensibility
-   Supporting more complicated configurations (master/slave,
    distributed)
-   Proper splitting of recipes, LWRP, attributes, data bags

-   Can start with mini tutorial from Opscode personnel or other domain
    or cookbook experts
-   How do we do collaborative group efforts

-   Start out with group web meeting
-   Break up into pairs or small groups to work on specifics using
    collaborative remote tools or at local meet ups
-   Way to allow people to ask for help / review

-   Get domain expert who may not be a chef expert

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   Create a wiki/ forum thru Opscode
-   Create a way to rendezvous with people who want to work on stuff on
    the wiki/forum
-   Wiki page on Opscode that at least points to things
-   Draw n community of specific domain experience
-   Coordinate with chef and devops meetups
