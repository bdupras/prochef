API Clients
===========

Overview
--------

##### This page provides an overview of the identity through which requests to the Chef server are authenticated through the [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API"), how the clients become registered with a valid identity, and how the API clients can be managed. See [Authentication and Authorization](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization") for details on the authentication and validation process itself.

  

Authentication Identity
-----------------------

In chef, node data is separate from the identity used to authenticate
requests to the Chef server, which is managed by an API client. Each API
client has a public/private key pair. The public half of the key is
stored in the database on the server, and the private half is kept
locally by the client.

-   On a node running the Chef Client, the private key is generally
    stored in /etc/chef/client.pem
-   For an administrator using knife, the private key is generally
    stored in \~/.chef/USERNAME.pem

Each request to the Chef server includes a request signature in the HTTP
headers. The request signature is computed from the hash of the request
content and encrypted with the client's private key to verify the
identity of the user or machine making the request and prevent attempts
to tamper with the content.
