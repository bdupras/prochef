Upgrading Chef 0.8.x to 0.9.x
=============================

This guide is for the installation methods supported by Opscode
(RubyGems and Debian packages).

Though it is a smoother transition than from 0.7 to 0.8, upgrading from
0.8 to 0.9 must be done lock-step. That is, 0.8 client and server are
incompatible with 0.9 client and server.

New [configuration
values](Chef%20Configuration%20Settings.html "Chef Configuration Settings")
available:

-   `sandbox_path` - `/var/chef/sandboxes`
-   `checksum_path` - `/var/chef/checksums`

These are for the new cookbook upload process to the Chef Server. You
will need to re-upload your cookbooks to the Chef server using Knife.

With that in mind, the basic upgrade process for chef-server is
described below. As always, remember to make backups and try the upgrade
in a test environment first.

Stop Server Services
--------------------

The deb packaging will stop the services for you. If you're using the
RubyGems installation, you'll need to stop the services the server runs
manually.

    for svc in server server-webui solr-indexer solr
    do
      sudo /etc/init.d/chef-${svc} stop
    done

    # client only:
    sudo /etc/init.d/chef-client stop

Make sure the 'merb' processes for the chef-server and chef-server-webui
are no longer running. They will look like this when running (port 4000
is the chef-server, port 4040 is the chef-server-webui):

    root      1035  0.1  0.0 112216  4276 ?        Sl   Jul07   5:44 merb : merb : master
    root      1784  6.5  0.6 146760 51984 ?        S    Jul07 290:40 merb : worker (port 4040)
    root      7547  0.1  0.4 110788 34104 ?        Sl   Jul09   3:00 merb : merb : master                                   
    root      7554  5.8  0.7 149912 57820 ?        S    Jul09 125:16 merb : worker (port 4000)

Upgrade Chef Server
-------------------

For RubyGems installation:

    # server:
    sudo gem install chef chef-server

Note that the 'chef-server' gem depends on chef-solr, chef-server-api
and chef-server-webui. If you do not want the webui:

    # server only w/ API:
    sudo gem install chef chef-server-api chef-solr

For a Debian/Ubuntu installation:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install chef chef-server

Modify /etc/chef/server.rb
--------------------------

If you wish to use non-default values for sandbox\_path and
checksum\_path, edit the server configuration file (server.rb). If you
are using the Chef cookbook to manage this, update the template.

The Debian packaging already handles this for you.

Restart the Services
--------------------

This is handled by the deb packaging for you.

    for svc in server server-webui solr-indexer solr
    do
      sudo /etc/init.d/chef-${svc} start
    done

    # client only:
    sudo /etc/init.d/chef-client start

Re-upload all cookbooks.
------------------------

You need to upload all the cookbooks. If your chef-repo is on the same
system as the chef-server, then simply run:

    knife cookbook upload -a

From the directory where your chef-repo is. If your chef-repo is on a
different system such as your local workstation, then upgrade the Chef
gem and run the knife command above.

Upgrade Clients
---------------

Upgrading the clients can now be done. Simply install the new gem and
restart the chef-client service.

    sudo gem install chef
    sudo /etc/init.d/chef-client restart

Debian packaging; the service will be stopped and started for you.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-install chef

Looks like if you upgrade from 0.8.16 to 0.9.8 you need to do the knife
cookbook upload -a twice. The first time does not properly load
cookbooks in your site-cookbooks directory that have the same name as a
cookbook in the cookbooks directory. (I believe this is CHEF-1571, which
is fixed in 0.9.10)

And as far as I can tell, you must also make sure that any cookbook in
your site-cookbooks has a version number in its metadata.rb that is
greater than the one in the coobooks directory.
