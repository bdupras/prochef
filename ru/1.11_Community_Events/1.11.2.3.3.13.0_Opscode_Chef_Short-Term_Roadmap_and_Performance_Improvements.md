#### Summary of discussions:

#### Rob Hirschfeld's Notes

Chef <3 Erlang

Scaling

-   moving to more Erlang on REST APIs, made a 2x in memory use
    difference
-   Erlang bits have realy steady performance

Database performance

-   they do not like CouchDB for their use cases
-   moving to mySQL, but will allow users to pick

Noop/Dry Run mode

-   asking for suggestions

Search improvements

-   tune for most common: single attribute & single mode
-   considering new syntax for simple search
-   subsets of data

Reporting

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

Q from Sean Horn: Are the search improvements mutually exclusive with
retaining all currently available search syntax? Could there be two
different modes?  
 I think there will always be someone who will miss the full power, even
when 90% don't need it.  
 A: (from @skeptomai) Some of the search improvements will dovetail
right in with the current implementation and will share and augment
syntax in a backward-compatible way.   
 We are thinking of a new feature as well, that fits many use cases, but
would have a different syntax.
