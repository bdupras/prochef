When you run chef-client, do you receive the error below?

    $ chef-client
    [Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:46:17 -0800] INFO: *** Chef 10.X.X ***
    [Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:46:18 -0800] WARN: Failed to read the private key /etc/chef/client.pem: #<Errno::EACCES: Permission denied - /etc/chef/client.pem>

You can resolve this by running the command as root. See **[Running Chef
Client with Elevated
Privileges](Running%20Chef%20Client%20with%20Elevated%20Privileges.html "Running Chef Client with Elevated Privileges")**
for how to accomplish this.
