### Opscode maintains the cookbooks we share on the [Opscode Community Cookbooks Site](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks) in the same manner as our other [Open Source projects](Developers.html "Developers").

**Opscode Cookbooks Testing**

Our full support for Opscode Cookbooks includes testing for
functionality and validating usability for [all platforms documented
below](#CookbookSupport-Whatdistributionsandreleasesdowesupport%3F).

  
 We provide assistance and guidance for our cookbooks to the Open Source
Chef community through the [Open Source Community Support
Channels](Support.html "Support"), including through [Chef Mailing
Lists](http://lists.opscode.com), [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/chef),
and through [directed support](mailto:support@opscode.com) for Hosted
Chef and Private Chef customers.

Opscode Hosted Chef and Opscode Private Chef customers can also open
support requests through our [support
site](http://www.opscode.com/support) or by emailing
[support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com). Directed support for
cookbooks rarely rises to a [high severity
level](http://www.opscode.com/support/incident-management/) based in the
[Service Level
Agreement](http://www.opscode.com/service-level-agreement) for escalated
response, as cookbook issues can be usually be resolved by modifying the
local copy as a workaround. We fully support our cookbooks, and commit
to doing so - endeavoring to respond to all Hosted Chef customer
questions ahead of our [service level
commitments](http://www.opscode.com/support/incident-management/).

What cookbooks are supported?
=============================

[Cannot resolve external resource into
attachment.](http://community.opscode.com/users/opscode)

##### All cookbooks that Opscode released under the "opscode" user on the Opscode Community site are supported.

*(The number of cookbooks on the screenshot may differ from the [actual
number](http://community.opscode.com/users/opscode))*

Cookbook source code repositories are available under the [Opscode
Cookbooks GitHub Organization](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks).  
Cookbooks in GitHub may be in the midst of a development cycle, *we
therefore recommend users download cookbooks from the Chef Community
site to ensure they are receiving the latest released version*.

We will provide our best effort in response to any questions that arise
in use of non-Opscode contributed cookbooks, but **Opscode does not test
or directly support cookbooks that other members of the community share
on the Opscode Community site.** Issues with non-Opscode provided and
supported cookbooks would need to be addressed with the provider, or
directly by the user through modifying the cookbook for their specific
environment.

How do I get cookbook support?
==============================

**Help with Using the Community Cookbook Site**

[Cookbook Site Help](Cookbook%20Site%20Help.html "Cookbook Site Help")
detail is available on the Wiki. Check [Cookbook Site
Help](Cookbook%20Site%20Help.html "Cookbook Site Help") first, the
resolution for issue with its use may be known and readily available.

If the interaction in [Open Source Support
Resources](Support.html "Support") results in a bug determination, all
users may open tickets in the [Open Source Bug Ticket Tracking
System](http://tickets.opscode.com/). To do so, use the COOK project,
specify the cookbook name as the component, and include as much
information about your environment as you can.

Opscode Hosted Chef and Opscode Private Chef customers may open a
directed support ticket at [support
site](http://www.opscode.com/support) or by emailing
[support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com) to request support for
a cookbook. Such tickets are typically classified as [Severity 3 or
4](http://www.opscode.com/support/incident-management/), and will
receive a response from Opscode consistent with that classification.
Questions or issues submitted through Support may result in a bug ticket
being opened in the [Open Source Bug Ticket Tracking
System](http://tickets.opscode.com/), depending upon the particular.

*Whether the ticket is opened through Support or through the Open Source
Bug Ticket System, please provide as much detail about the cookbook as
possible.*

-   Node platform and version
-   Version of Chef
-   Log and stack trace output (if any)
-   Cookbook name and version
-   The failing resource code from the recipe

The more information provided, the more likely we can respond with a
proper solution in a timely manner. Often, we can provide a workaround
that can be implemented immediately.

What distributions and releases do we support?
==============================================

Declaring specific distribution support across the board is difficult.
Every platform has differing opinions and implementations of the
software our cookbooks install and configure.

**Any cookbook that Opscode releases will indicate the platforms it
supports**. For supported platforms: Opscode personnel have converged a
node of that platform by following the instructions in the cookbook's
documentation, and validated the functionality provided by the cookbook
is implemented.

Cookbooks are documented with a README file in the root of the cookbook,
which is distributed in the downloadable archive file. For example:

    % knife cookbook site download apache2
    Downloading apache2 from the cookbooks site at version 1.0.2 to /Users/jtimberman/Downloads/apache2-1.0.2.tar.gz
    Cookbook saved: /Users/jtimberman/Downloads/apache2-1.0.2.tar.gz

    % tar -zxvf apache2-1.0.2.tar.gz 
    ...

    % ls -1 apache2
    README.md          <---- Here it is!
    attributes/
    definitions/
    files/
    metadata.json
    metadata.rb
    recipes/
    templates/

***We focus cookbook supportability on the following platforms and
versions***

-   Ubuntu (10.04, 11.04, 11.10)
-   Debian (5.0, 6.0)
-   RHEL / CentOS (5.x, 6.x)
-   Fedora 14+
-   Mac OS X (10.5+)
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008 R2

As time progresses, older versions of distributions may be removed from
support in the cookbook without warning.

***Platform versions not explicitly stated above may (or may not)
function as expected***

Opscode has simply not *tested and validated functionality* on all
possible platforms beyond those listed above. The Opscode cookbooks may
require modifications for full functionality on alternate platforms, and
on those platforms we cannot guarantee any particular functionality or
clean exit.

Also, some cookbooks may not be relevant for a particular platform. (For
example, you can add "`recipe[iis]`" to an Ubuntu node, and it will fail
to converge.) *It is up to the customer to understand the purpose of the
cookbooks they're adding to their nodes.* (i.e.: "This stuff runs as
root!")

**As part of ongoing maintenance of the Cookbooks, Opscode may add
functionality for other platforms to existing cookbooks.** The supported
platforms will always be included in the cookbook README and metadata.
*It is up to the customer to read the cookbook's documentation and note
the supported platforms listed in the README and the cookbook metadata.*
If a customer or user of a cookbook has a modification that would
provide additional functionality, or extend the cookbook to an alternate
platform, we'd be happy to included it - please see the next section for
how to contribute that change.

How do I contribute to Opscode Cookbooks?
=========================================

Opscode Cookbooks are maintained in the same manner as Chef and our
other Open Source products. Details are available in the
