Ohai Overview
-------------

##### Ohai detects data about your operating system. It can be used standalone, but its primary purpose is to provide node data to Chef.

When invoked, it collects detailed, extensible information about the
machine it's running on, including Chef configuration, hostname, FQDN,
networking, memory, CPU, platform, and kernel data.

When used standalone, Ohai will print out a JSON data blob for all the
known data about your system. When used with Chef, that JSON output is
reported back via "automatic" node
[attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") to update the node object on
the chef-server.

**Ohai Version Dependencies**

-   Use of Ohai Version 0.6.x, requires the use of Chef version 0.9.x or
    greater.

-   Chef version 0.10 requires Ohai Version 0.6.x or greater, and will
    not function with earlier versions.
