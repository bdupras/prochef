**Chef Client is a Chef agent that runs on your nodes.**   
 Chef-client connects to a Chef Server to be told what to do on the
node.

**Chef Solo is a standalone version of Chef that runs locally on your
node, detached from a Chef server.**   
 This means that all the information and Cookbooks required to configure
the node have to be present on the local disk.

  
 Both are shipped together and can be installed using the Operating
System-specific directions listed below.
