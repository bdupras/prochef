Migrating to Hosted Chef from an Open Source Chef Server implementation
=======================================================================

  

  

### If you run your own Open Source Chef Server and want all the benefits of configuration management with none of the adminstration hassle, you can migrate to [Hosted Chef](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/) without losing the work you've already done. Here's how...

Benefits
--------

As a Hosted Chef Customer you...

-   are free from managing your own Chef server(s) as your business
    scales. You get back to focusing on core business essentials.
-   benefit immediately from new versions of Chef and the Opscode API
    when they are released. Data migrations and backwards compatibility
    are taken care of by Opscode, virtually eliminating the work that
    may be required for major upgrades.
-   don't worry about scalability. As you move from tens to hundreds to
    thousands of systems under management, Hosted Chef will gracefully
    handle the load, with no concurrent increase in management overhead.
-   are protected by an industry-leading SLA and 24x7x365 support
    options, giving you the confidence to run mission-critical systems.

Approach
--------

Migrate by taking the following actions:

#### 1. Prepare your backup.

-   Download the following [Knife
    Plugin](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins")
    ([backup\_export.rb](https://raw.github.com/stevendanna/knife-hacks/master/plugins/backup_export.rb)):

<!-- -->

    cd ~/path/to/chef/repository
    mkdir -p .chef/plugins/knife
    curl https://raw.github.com/stevendanna/knife-hacks/master/plugins/backup_export.rb > .chef/plugins/knife/backup_export.rb

-   Run the knife plugin to backup your existing Chef Server:

<!-- -->

    knife backup export

This will export from the chef server all data bags, roles,
environments, and nodes, storing them as JSON files within the
`.chef/chef_server_backup` directory.

These JSON files will later be uploaded to Hosted Chef in step 5.

#### 2. Create your accounts and organization on Hosted Chef.

See [Setup Opscode User and
Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
for detailed instructions on creating a new organization. Rather than
creating a new, local chef repository, you can reconfigure your current
repository to use Hosted Chef.

-   Replace `.chef/knife.rb` with the version provided by the
    [Management console](http://manage.opscode.com).
-   Move your Hosted Chef user's authentication key into the `.chef`
    directory, and
-   Move your Hosted Chef organization's validator key into the `.chef`
    directory.

#### 3. Confirm that your new Opscode Hosted Chef organization has no nodes and just the validator client

    knife node list
    knife client list

The only client that should be listed is your organization's validator
client. No nodes should be listed.

#### 4. Register your existing servers with Hosted Chef

Use a custom [Knife Bootstrap](Knife%20Bootstrap.html "Knife Bootstrap")
template to populate the nodes with the correct configuration file and
validation certificate, delete the existing client certificate, and run
chef-client to register the node as a new API client to the Opscode
Hosted Chef Organization.

If your nodes are running a Microsoft Windows platform, you will need to
use the [Knife Windows
Bootstrap](Knife%20Windows%20Bootstrap.html "Knife Windows Bootstrap")
and modify the template for the Windows platform. Be sure to remove the
client.pem file, typically `c:\chef\client.pem`.

**Note** *This assumes, as above, that your Hosted Chef organization has
no data for these nodes. The run list will be empty. We will populate
that from the backed up node data in a later step. It is important to
bootstrap the nodes at this stage before restoring the backup, in order
to avoid creating a permissions issue.*

-   Save the following script as `.chef/bootstrap/migration.erb` within
    your chef repository. **Note** *if you customized the client.rb, you
    will need to modify this script.*

<!-- -->

    bash -c '
    # removed installation, presumably Chef is installed on existing nodes

    rm /etc/chef/client.pem /etc/chef/validation.pem

    (
    cat <<'EOP'
    <%= validation_key %>
    EOP
    ) > /tmp/validation.pem
    awk NF /tmp/validation.pem > /etc/chef/validation.pem
    rm /tmp/validation.pem

    (
    cat <<'EOP'
    <%= config_content %>
    EOP
    ) > /etc/chef/client.rb

    chef-client
    '

-   Run this bootstrap on each of your nodes. The exact command will
    depend on how your environment is configured. To run this on a node
    running Ubuntu you may execute the command:

<!-- -->

    knife bootstrap TARGET_IPADDR -d migration -x ubuntu --sudo

#### 5. Upload data to your Hosted Chef organization

You can restore the node data using a [Knife
Plugin](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins")
([backup\_restore.rb](https://github.com/stevendanna/knife-hacks/blob/master/plugins/backup_restore.rb)):

    cd ~/path/to/chef/repo
    curl https://raw.github.com/stevendanna/knife-hacks/master/plugins/backup_restore.rb > .chef/plugins/knife/backup_restore.rb
    knife backup restore

Alternatively, can upload the data by hand:

-   **node data**  
     For each of the files found in the `nodes` directory of your chef
    backup, do the following:

        knife node from file /path/to/chef/backup/nodes/some_node.json

    Running this command will repopulate the newly created nodes with
    their previous run\_list and attributes.

-   **cookbooks**  
     From a chef repository configured to use hosted chef and containing
    all of your cookbooks do:

        knife cookbook upload -a

-   **roles**  
     For each of the files found in the `roles` directory of your chef
    backup, do the following:

        knife role from file /path/to/chef/backup/roles/some_role.json

-   **data bags**  
     For each of the files found in the `data_bags` directory of your
    chef backup, do the following:

        knife data bag from file /path/to/chef/backup/data_bags/some_bag.json

#### 6. Run chef-client on all of your nodes

Depending on your environment, this could be done via knife ssh:

    knife ssh 'name:*' 'sudo chef-client'
