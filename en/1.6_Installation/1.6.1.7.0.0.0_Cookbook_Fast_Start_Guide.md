Cookbook Fast Start Guide
=========================

Overview
========

![image](../attachments/18645295/19005511.jpg)  
[Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") are how things are distributed
and shared in Chef. Most of your time building infrastructure in Chef
will be spent writing [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks"); this page
is a quick guide to writing and using Chef Cookbooks. It isn't
comprehensive, but it will show how some basic components work and we'll
explain some terms along the way. To learn more about Chef's
terminology, check out the [Chef
Basics](Chef%20Basics.html "Chef Basics") section. If you want more
details about how Chef is structured architecturally, check out the
[Chef Architecture](Architecture.html "Architecture") section.

#### At this point, you should have completed the [installation process](Installation.html "Installation") and have a working Chef server.

If you are using Hosted Chef, you can run these commands from the
management workstation you've setup.

### Get a [Chef Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository")

A Chef repository is just a directory structure where you keep your
cookbooks and other files. If you haven't done so already, clone
Opscode's Chef repository from github:

**Clone the Chef Repository from Opscode**

    shell > cd /tmp/sandbox
    shell > git clone git://github.com/opscode/chef-repo.git
