### Often it's desirable not to load certain Ohai plugins.

##### An example of this is the passwd plugin, should your nodes be connected to a large LDAP directory.

##### To see long it takes to load various Ohai plugins, see [https://gist.github.com/1323597](https://gist.github.com/1323597)

**No effect on the "ohai" executable**  
  
 Please note that the `client.rb` configuration file is ignored by the
`ohai` executable.

**It is therefore not possible to disable plugins when running `ohai`
manually.**   

###### To do this, add the following line to `/etc/chef/client.rb`; this examples shows 4 plugins being disabled:

    Ohai::Config[:disabled_plugins] = ["passwd", "rackspace", "dmi", "dmi_common"]

###### To see the list of available plugins run:

    gem content ohai | grep lib/ohai/plugins

###### To test the effect of disabling plugins run the following command and look for the string "`Skipping disabled plugin XXXX`":

    chef-client -l debug
