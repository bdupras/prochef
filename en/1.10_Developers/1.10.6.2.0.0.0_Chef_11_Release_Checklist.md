Chef 11 Release Checklist
=========================

A list of small dev tasks that we need to do for Chef 11
--------------------------------------------------------

-   Deprecate Chef::ShellOut compatibility layer - replaced by
    Mixlib::ShellOut
-   Remove Chef::REST\#run\_request (replaced by api\_request and
    streaming\_request)
-   Implement platform\_family for platform-specific resource Mapping.
-   remove cookbook overlays, add support for multiple cookbook versions
    in different cookbook directories
-   merb -\> rails3 for webui (opscode esprint-1200)
-   seen\_recipes
    [CHEF-2992](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2992)
-   Run delayed notifications even on failure.
-   update the constructor for Provider to take the action to be
    executed.
-   remove support for specifying multiple notifications in one call to
    `Resource#notifies`. Users should instead use multiple calls to
    `#notifies` (the documentation is already consistent with this).

Proposed
--------

-   rename Chef::REST get\_rest, put\_rest, etc. without the "\_rest",
    replace with aliases to the old names and deprecate those
-   move Homebrew provider into core chef
