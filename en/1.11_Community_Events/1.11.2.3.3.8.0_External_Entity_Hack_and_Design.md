#### Summary of discussions:

Continued from [11 AM - E - Management of External
Entitites](Management%20of%20External%20Entitites.html "Management of External Entitites")

Dell's priorities on this Network -\> SAN -\> Chassis  
 First pass thoughts:

-   cookbook: managed node manager
-   recipe that sets up the manged node environment (LXE or chroot)
-   generate set of chron scripts to run chef-client in the protected
    environment
-   what about using the "full path installer"
-   first pass, we are only talking about 3-8 managed nodes per system
-   manage node manager that can run multiple of those
-   want to be able to poke the managed node
-   need ohaithere plug in that builds the node object w/ data that's
    specific to the managed nodes
-   we envision a set of chained recipes (aka barclamps in Crowbar)
-   need a disk system to play w/ DAS
-   shared configs
-   ohai needs to have no plugins (that would be confusing)
-   each container would have its own IP address
-   this helps w/ use on manage and remote invokation

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

Greg is writing it - watch Crowbar.
