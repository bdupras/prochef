Managing Clients with the Hosted Chef Management Console
========================================================

  

### The Management Console can be used to manage your clients

-   ##### Listing Clients

-   ##### Deleting Clients

-   ##### Creating a New Client

-   ##### Regenerating the Private Key for the Client API

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, node or other data in the
    Management Console instead, return to the [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Clients
-------

On Hosted Chef, "[API Clients](API%20Clients.html "API Clients")" are
entities that are similar to Users, except that clients are always
scoped to your organization and only have access to the Hosted Chef API.
API Clients are used by chef-client to authenticate when connecting to
Hosted Chef. Typically, there is one client for each node under
management.

When you first sign up, a "validator" client is created for your
organization named `ORGANIZATION-validator.pem`. This "validator" client
can be used to create new clients for your organization via the Hosted
Chef API. *If the "validator" client is deleted for any reason, you will
need to recreate it to authenticate new nodes.* Be careful not to let
this happen, if it does, following directions on the [Common
Errors](Common%20Errors.html#CommonErrors-401Unauthorized%2528usingvalidatorAPIclient%2529)
page will to recreate it.

Anyone in possession of a client's private key can do anything on your
Hosted Chef account that the client is authorized to do, so be sure to
protect you clients' private keys. These keys are typically created the
first time a given chef-client connects to Hosted Chef, and stored
locally on the node.

**You can also manage clients with the command line tool
[Knife](Knife.html "Knife").**

Listing Clients
---------------

In order to see a list of the clients in the organization:

1. Log in to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Select the *Clients* tab and you will see a list similar to this:

**Note:** You need [list
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global clients level to list the clients.

Deleting Clients
----------------

In order to delete a client:

1. Log in to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Select the *Clients* tab

3. Click on the *delete* link next to the client you want to delete.

**Do not delete the validator client, which will be named
ORGANIZATION-validator or you will be unable to authenticate new nodes
until you [recreate the validator
key](Common%20Errors.html#CommonErrors-401Unauthorized%2528usingvalidatorAPIclient%2529).**

This will prevent that client from authenticating to Hosted Chef.

**Note:** You need [delete
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the client to delete it.

Creating a New Client
---------------------

New clients are typically created by chef-client when it first connects
to Hosted Chef, so there is no need in that case to manually create a
new client.

If you need to manually create one, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Select the *Clients* tab

3. Click on the *Create* sub-menu

4. Enter a name for the client and press *Create Client*. A link to your
client's private key will be shown. Opscode does not store your private
keys, so be sure to download and save the private key. You can generate
a new private key if you lose it, however.

**Note:** You need [create
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global clients level to create a client.

Regenerating a private key for an Opscode API Client
----------------------------------------------------

Regenerating a client's private key invalidates the client's old private
key and replaces it with a new one. Regenerating the key will be useful
if you have lost the client's private key, if the client's private key
has been exposed to someone you don't want to have access to your Hosted
Chef account, or if you wish to regularly rotate keys for security
purposes.

### Regenerating the Key via the Hosted Chef Management Console

In order to regenerate a client's private key:

1. Log in to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Select the *Clients* tab

3. Click on the *regenerate private key* link next to the client whose
key you want to regenerate:

![image](../attachments/19923221/20086891.png)

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the client to recreate this key.

Your new private key will start downloading. Save this key! There is no
way for Opscode to recover the key if you lose it, though you can
generate a new key again.

### Regenerating the Key with Knife

To regenerate a client's key with knife, use \`knife client reregister
CLIENT\`. This is explained further in the [API
Clients](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/API+Clients#APIClients-RegenerateaclientprivatekeywithKnife)
article.
