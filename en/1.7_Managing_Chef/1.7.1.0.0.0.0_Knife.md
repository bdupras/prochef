What is Knife?
==============

### Knife is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that comes with Chef.

#### It is used by administrators to interact with the Chef [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API") and the local Chef repository. It provides the capability to manipulate nodes, cookbooks, roles, databags, environments, etc., and can also be used to provision cloud resources and to bootstrap systems.

Overview
========

##### Knife commands all have the following form

    knife sub-command [ARGUMENTS] (options)

As the administrators command line tool for interacting for the chef
server, Knife is run from [the management
workstation](Architecture%20Introduction.html#ArchitectureIntroduction-ChefServer%2CNodes%2CandWorkstations),
acting as the intersection between the Chef Server and your
infrastructure.

Knife interacts with the Chef Server through the same [REST
API](Server%20API.html "Server API") that the [Chef
Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") software uses, authenticating
as an [API client](API%20Clients.html "API Clients"). Hosted Chef and
Private Chef then have the additional role based authentication controls
(RBAC) that authorize changes based upon users and organizations. See
[Authentication and
Authorization](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization")
for more information on this model.

Knife comes with a series of [built in
subcommands](Knife%20Built%20In%20Subcommands.html "Knife Built In Subcommands"),
which provide the functionality and capability for specific actions upon
cookbooks, nodes, roles, etc. within your infrastructure. Knife also has
the capability to be a container for [Knife
Plugins](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins") - which extend its
functionality beyond the built in commands to features including
launching cloud instances and bootstrapping systems.

There is a built in contextual help system for obtaining more
information on the commands and subcommands, options for their use, or
reviewing manpage documentation. When you go through [Workstation
Setup](Workstation%20Setup.html "Workstation Setup"), one of the actions
includes establishing and configuring knife for use. Subsequent
modifications can be made through editing the knife.rb configuration
file.

  

[Knife Built In Subcommands](Knife%20Built%20In%20Subcommands.html "Knife Built In Subcommands")
================================================================================================

The following subcommands are built into Knife, and available for
managing their respective components from the Knife command line
interface.  
 See **[Knife Built In
Subcommands](Knife%20Built%20In%20Subcommands.html "Knife Built In Subcommands")**
for details on use of each.

*[return to top of page](#Knife-top)*

##### Knife sub-commands are structured to take the form   
`NOUN verb NOUN` (options)

Because the Chef Server API is RESTful, the `verb` of a knife command is
generally a CRUD operation:

-   **create** (create)
-   **list** and show (read)
-   **edit** (update)
-   **delete** (destroy)

##### Subcommands built into Knife:

-   Bootstrap
-   Client
-   Cloud Plugins
-   Configure
-   Cookbook
-   Cookbook Site
-   Data Bag
-   Environment
-   Exec
-   Node
-   Recipe
-   Role
-   Search
-   SSH
-   Status
-   Tag

  

Contextual Help
===============

Knife has a smart contextual help system built right in.

*[return to top of page](#Knife-top)*

##### If you invoke knife with the `--help` option at the top level you will see options common to all subcommands.

    % knife --help

**Knife has a Man Page**  
The man page for knife is the authoritative reference for knife. It is
also shipped with the chef gem, rpm and deb. It can be easily accessed
using knife's built-in help system:

    knife help knife

  

##### You can then read individual pages by using a command in the form of:

    knife help topic

Configuring Your System For Knife
=================================

  

Knife configuration
-------------------

The knife configuration file is a Ruby DSL to set configuration
parameters for Knife's common options.

*[return to top of page](#Knife-top)*

Knife's configuration file is named `knife.rb`. *Unless directly passed
the configuration file location via the `-c` command line option, Knife
searches for this configuration by searching for `.chef/knife.rb`,
starting at the current working directory and moving upward.* If no
configuration is found `~/.chef/knife.rb` is used if it exists.

##### The following parameters can be set in `knife.rb`:

-   `node_name`:  
     User or client identity (i.e., name) to use for authenticating
    requests to the Chef Server.
-   `client_key`:  
     Private key file to authenticate to the Chef server. Corresponds to
    the -k or --key option.
-   `chef_server_url`:  
     URL of the Chef server. Corresponds to the -s or --server-url
    option. This is requested from the user when running this
    sub-command.
-   `cache_type`:  
     The type of cache to use. Default is BasicFile. This can be any
    type of Cache that moneta supports: BasicFile, Berkeley, Couch,
    DataMapper, File, LMC, Memcache, Memory, MongoDB, Redis, Rufus, S3,
    SDBM, Tyrant, Xattr, YAML.
-   `cache_option`:  
     Specifies various options to use for caching. These options are
    dependent on the cache\_type.
-   `validation_client_name`:  
     Specifies the name of the client used to validate new clients.
-   `validation_key`:  
     Specifies the private key file to use when bootstrapping new hosts.
    See knife-client(1) for more information about the validation
    client.
-   `cookbook_copyright`, `cookbook_email`, `cookbook_license`:  
     Used by knife cookbook create sub-command to specify the copyright
    holder, maintainer email and license (respectively) for new
    cookbooks. The copyright holder is listed as the maintainer in the
    cookbook's metadata and as the Copyright in the comments of the
    default recipe. The maintainer email is used in the cookbook
    metadata. The license determines what preamble to put in the comment
    of the default recipe, and is listed as the license in the cookbook
    metadata. Currently supported licenses are "apachev2" and "none".
    Any other values will result in an empty license in the metadata
    (needs to be filled in by the author), and no comment preamble in
    the default recipe.

  

[Knife Plugins](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins")
-----------------------------------------------------

As Chef will load commands from a set of specific locations, you can
create plugins for reuse across projects in your home directory, share
plugins with your team by including them in your cookbook repo, and
share plugins with the whole Chef community by distributing them as Ruby
gems.

*[return to top of page](#Knife-top)*

With Chef 0.10, knife will load commands from the following locations:

-   The core set of knife commands shipped with Chef
-   Commands in your home chef directory: \~/.chef/plugins/knife/
-   Commands in a .chef/plugins/knife/ directory in your cookbook repo
-   Commands located in a chef/knife/ directory in a Ruby Gem you have
    installed.

See **[Knife Plugins](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins")** for
details on creating and installing plugins, and **[Community
Plugins](Community%20Plugins.html "Community Plugins")** for a listing
of plugins that have been made available by Chef community members.

  

EDITOR Environment Variable
---------------------------

Many knife commands use the EDITOR environment variable when create or
editing objects that will be saved on the Chef Server.

*[return to top of page](#Knife-top)*

##### You can set this variable when issuing the command.

    > EDITOR=nano knife node edit NODENAME

##### Alternatively you can set the variable for the rest of your shell's session.

    > export EDITOR=nano
    > knife node edit NODENAME

See your shell's documentation for information on how to ensure that
EDITOR is always set when you start a new shell.

Command and Output Options
==========================

  

Common Options
--------------

The following options can be passed to any subcommand. For sub-command
specific options, see the section of [Knife Built In
Subcommands](Knife%20Built%20In%20Subcommands.html "Knife Built In Subcommands")
for the relevant subcommand.

-   `-s`, `--server-url URL`:  
     Chef Server URL
-   `-k`, `--key KEY`:  
     API Client Key
-   `--color`:  
     Use colored output
-   `-c`, `--config CONFIG`:  
     The configuration file to use
-   `--defaults`:  
     Accept default values for all questions
-   `-e`, `--editor EDITOR`:  
     Set the editor to use for interactive commands
-   `-E`, `--environment ENVIRONMENT`:  
     Set the Chef environment
-   `-F`, `--format FORMAT`:  
     Which format to use for output. See the Output Formats section
    below.
-   `--no-color`:  
     Don't use colors in the output
-   `-n`, `--no-editor`:  
     Do not open EDITOR, just accept the data as is
-   `-u`, `--user USER`:  
     API Client Username
-   `--print-after`:  
     Show the data after a destructive operation
-   `-V`, `--verbose`:  
     More verbose output. Use twice for max verbosity
-   `-v`, `--version`:  
     Show chef version
-   `-y`, `--yes`:  
     Say yes to all prompts for confirmation
-   `-h`, `--help`:  
     Show this message

  

![image](images/icons/emoticons/information.gif)

**Knife Output Change**  
  
 The default knife output changed with version 0.10. Previous version of
knife output JSON while 0.10 formats its output for human consumption.

*Knife will still output JSON if passed the option **`-Fj`** at the
command line.*

Output Formats
--------------

The amount of content displayed and the output format can be modified by
the \`--format\` option. If no alternate format is selected, the default
is summary.

Valid formats are:

-   `summary`:  
     displays the node in a custom, summarized format (default)
-   `text`:  
     displays the node data in its entirety using the colorized tree
    display
-   `json`:  
     displays the node in JSON format
-   `yaml`:  
     displays the node in YAML format
-   `pp`:  
     displays the node using Ruby's pretty printer.

For brevity, only the first character of the format is required, for
example, -Fj will produce JSON format output.

  

Bash Command Completion
=======================

Get the code here: from [Gist](https://gist.github.com/1050685)  
 To use, you need the `bash-completion` package; Source the script from
`.bashrc` or elsewhere.  
 The script uses the KNIFE\_HOME variable to location knife.rb, so be
sure to export it if your knife.rb is can't be found.

Completion cache
----------------

The completion reads completion alternatives from knife invocations and
can be a little slow without caching. To enable the cache, simply create
the directory `$KNIFE_HOME/.chef/.completion_cache` (KNIFE\_HOME
defaults to $HOME/.chef)  
 Since environment, role, node and data bag names are cached cache
cleanup may be necessary when they change. Simply delete the files in
the completion directory.

Bash command completion on OS X (Tested on OS X 10.7.3)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Install bash-completion

    brew install bash-completion

2. Install gnu-sed

    brew install gnu-sed

3. Create local bash-completion dir

    mkdir ~/bash_completion.d/

4. Install knife completions

    Get the code here: https://gist.github.com/1050685
    cd ~/bash_completion.d/ && copy the code from the gist above into the file ~/bash_completion.d/knife

5. Source core brew-installed bash completion and then our knife stuff
in \~/.bash\_profile

    if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion
    fi

    if [ -f ~/bash_completion.d/knife ]; then
      . ~/bash_completion.d/knife
    fi

6. Source your \~/.bash\_profile again to refresh

    . ~/.bash_profile

If you are using Mac OS X and want to use the knife bash completions
mentioned on this page and you are using *brew* instead of *Macports*
the command to install *gsed* is:  
`brew install gnu-sed`

You'll also have to install bash\_completion no mater if you are using
*Macports* or *brew*. Some good instructions for this and other Mac OS X
setup goodness at
