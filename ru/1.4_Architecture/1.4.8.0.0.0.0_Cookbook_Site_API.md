Cookbook Site API
=================

  

#### Opsocode maintains a public collection of cookbooks at the [cookbooks.opscode.com](http://cookbooks.opscode.com). This collection is accessible via a [REST API](Server%20API.html "Server API"). This article documents the REST API methods accepted by the cookbooks site.

Introduction
============

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of distribution in Chef. They are how
you encapsulate all the different resources you need to automate your
infrastructure, and they are the component that is easily sharable
between different Chef users. Opscode maintains a public collection of
cookbooks at cookbooks.opscode.com. This site contains all the cookbooks
authored by Opscode, as well as many cookbooks from other members of the
community.

All the cookbooks on the site are accessible through a REST API rooted
at cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/. The endpoints and their HTTP methods
are described below.

**In most cases, using this API directly is unnecessary.** *Rather, you
should use the `knife cookbook site` sub-commands or interact directly
with the [Cookbooks site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com).* See
**[Knife](Knife.html "Knife")** and **[Cookbook Site
Help](Cookbook%20Site%20Help.html "Cookbook Site Help")** for more
details.
