===============

Opscode stewards a number of open-source projects, which includes managing new releases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  ##### First, a [Ticket](http://tickets.opscode.com) is filed under the affected project calling for a new feature or bug fix

2.  ##### An [approved contributor](Approved%20Contributors.html "Approved Contributors") from the community provides the fix, possibly the same individual that filed the ticket

3.  ##### Opscode triages the ticket and merges it into a development branch

4.  ##### The feature or bug fix is included in the next release of the project.

Tickets
-------

The cornerstone of the release process is our [ticketing
system](http://tickets.opscode.com). All bug fixes and new features are
documented under a ticket. This allows a global community to identify,
document, reproduce and fix issues.

For the Chef and Ohai projects we follow this process. It differs
slightly for others:

1.  Ticket is filed describing a bug or desired feature
2.  Any further documentation detailing the reproduction of the bug is
    added
3.  A discussion may occur on the mailing list
4.  Someone provides a possible fix and the ticket is marked
    resolved/fixed
5.  The ticket is reviewed in one of Opscode's weekly triage meetings.
    If the fix is accepted for merge, it is marked 'Triaged,' otherwise
    it may be reopened for further work or rejected for a technical
    reason that will be specified.
    1.  The contributor is validated as an [approved
        contributor](Approved%20Contributors.html "Approved Contributors")
    2.  The code is reviewed

6.  If the fix includes code, on a regular merge pass against triaged
    tickets:
    1.  Unit tests are run
    2.  A merge is completed
    3.  fixVersion is set to the version of Chef that this will be
        included in
    4.  The ticket is closed

Contributing
------------

For information on contributing, the process is fully described at [How
to Contribute](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute").

Versioning
----------

The projects follow a versioning process similar to that documented by
[Rubygems](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7).

**Versions are represented by a series of three integers separated by
periods, representing major, minor and point releases respectively.**

Chef and Ohai currently use the minor version to indicate changes that
may include breaking changes, while other projects use the major version
similar to other projects. These types of changes may include a change
to the API that is not backward compatible, or a change in the default
behavior of a provider.

-   An even numbered point version represents an official published
    release.
-   An odd numbered point release means that you're using a development
    version.  
     (While this can help identify that you've installed a project from
    the source code, it is important to remember that two installations
    with the same development version may not actually be the same based
    in development changes having occurred during the time between which
    the two same numbered development versions were installed.)

If needed, beta and release candidates are indiciated by a suffix of
'.beta.x' or '.rc.x' respectively, where x is an integer.

For example, if the last published release was 1.0.0 and the current
development release is 1.0.1, we may release:

-   1.0.2.beta.1,
-   1.0.2.beta.2,
-   1.0.2.rc.1, then
-   1.0.2 (final).

This is used because Gems, which is our primary method of releasing the
code, consider any version with a letter in it as a
[pre-release](http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/rubygems-update/Gem/Version.html#method-i-prerelease-3F),
allowing us to push it to rubygems.org for download, but ensuring it
won't be installed accidentally without the use of the '--pre' gem
command flag.
