Build a Django Stack
====================

#### Build a Django application stack using Chef cookbooks available from the [Cookbooks Community Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) and Hosted Chef.

The Walkthrough Guide assumes you followed the [Fast Start
Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide") and have Chef
installed and working with the Hosted Chef platform.

**At the end of this guide, you'll have four total Ubuntu 10.04 systems
running in Amazon EC2.**

-   1 haproxy load balancer.
-   2 Django (Gunicorn) application servers.
-   1 MySQL database server.

If you don't already have an account with Amazon AWS, go to [Amazon Web
Sevices](http://aws.amazon.com/) and click "Sign up". You'll need the
access and secret access key credentials from the sign-up later.

  
 The Django application used in this guide leverages the [Django
CMS](http://djangocms.org/) application. The source code for our Django
application can be [downloaded on the Opscode GitHub
account](https://github.com/opscode/django-quick-start-cms). This
application follows the [out of the box setup
instructions](https://www.django-cms.org/en/documentation/) found on the
Django CMS project site. We have also created a [pip requirements
file](http://pip.openplans.org/requirement-format.html) for tracking
project dependancies.

We're going to reuse a number of cookbooks from the [Cookbooks Community
Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) to build the environment. For
example, the source code lives in **git**, so that cookbook will ensure
Git is available. The load balancer is **haproxy** because it is very
simple to deploy and configure, and we use a recipe that automatically
discovers the Django application systems. The heavy lifting is handled
by recipes in the **application** and **database** cookbooks.

The **application** cookbook will perform the following steps:

-   create an application specific virtualenv
-   install required packages and pips into the project specific
    virtualenv
-   set up the deployment scaffolding
-   creates settings\_local.py file with the database connection
    information if required
-   performs a revision-based deploy
-   install Gunicorn
-   create an application specific Gunicorn configuration file
-   create a Runit service for managing Gunicorn
