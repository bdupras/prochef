#### Summary of discussions:

We discussed challenges and solutions for managing big data clusters
with Chef. Points covered included

-   There are good cookbooks for managing Cassandra.
    [https://github.com/riptano/chef/tree/master/cookbooks/cassandra](https://github.com/riptano/chef/tree/master/cookbooks/cassandra)
    is one of them
-   Work on the voldemort cookbook will be shared.
-   [Cluster Chef](https://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef) has
    cookbooks for Hadoop but mostly specific to Cluster Chef
-   Talked about storage on EC2. Some find ephemeral storage to work
    well. EBS + RAID0 also works well.
-   EBS volumes can be attached w/ IAM restricted keys. Can also have
    the node make a call to a broker webservice that talks to the EC2
    API.
-   Cassandra Stress Test, part of the Cassandra distribution, can be
    used to benchmark performance
-   [Rhino](https://github.com/whitepages/rhino) is an ORM for hbase.
-   Talked about monitoring. Ganglia in EC2 requires use of unicast and
    can be an issue when lots of nodes are in flux.
-   [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) +
    [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) is useful for trending.

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

-   Investigate tools mentioned during the discussion
-   Automate cluster deloyments
