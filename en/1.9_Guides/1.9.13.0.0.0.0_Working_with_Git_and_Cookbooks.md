==============================

#### Cookbook Development Workflow for Chef Cookbooks

##### This page describes development workflow for Chef cookbooks using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as the version control system.

  
*It is not a comprehensive guide to Git*, to learn more about Git
itself:

-   [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation)
-   [Learn Git](http://learn.github.com/)
-   [Pro Git](http://progit.org/book/)

**This page will walk through five examples:**

-   Building a new cookbook and saving it to the [local
    repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository").
-   Downloading an existing cookbook from the [Chef Community
    Site](http://community.opscode.com).
-   Modifying an existing cookbook in the local repository for new
    updates.
-   Using Version Control to check the last change made to the [local
    repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository").
-   Adding a [remote
    repository](#WorkingwithGitandCookbooks-RemoteRepositories) url to
    the git directory so you can push the commits to your own remote git
    repo.   

Pre-requisites
==============

The user should already have cloned the skeleton [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository") from Opscode's
GitHub repository.

**git clone Opscode's chef-repo skeleton**

    % git clone git://github.com/opscode/chef-repo.git
    Cloning into chef-repo...
    remote: Counting objects: 173, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (106/106), done.
    remote: Total 173 (delta 62), reused 138 (delta 40)
    Receiving objects: 100% (173/173), 27.25 KiB, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (62/62), done.

The remaining examples will be done from the chef-repo directory.

**Work from chef-repo**

    % cd chef-repo
    % git status 
    # On branch master
    nothing to commit (working directory clean)

As this is already a git repository, it's already set up for you to use
with Git. However, the remote origin is still Opscode's repository. See
the [remote
repositories](#WorkingwithGitandCookbooks-RemoteRepositories) section of
this article for information on remote repositories in Git.
