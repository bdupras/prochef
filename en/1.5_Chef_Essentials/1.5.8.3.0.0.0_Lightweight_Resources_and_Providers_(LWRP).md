Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP)
==========================================

  

Overview
========

##### In Chef, [Resources](Resources.html "Resources") represent a piece of system state and [Providers](Providers.html "Providers") are the underlying implementation which brings them into that state.   
  
 For example, all database vendors support the abstract concept of database creation, but the underlying implementation is different for each.  
  
 While typical Resources and Providers are implemented in Chef's core using Ruby classes, implementing Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP) is quick and easy, requiring less Ruby knowledge than their heavier counterparts. (LWRP's also become Ruby classes, but this is done for you, behind the scenes).

  
**This document covers the DSL for creating Resources and Providers.**
It is not meant to be an in-depth description of the implementation, but
details are sprinkled throughout for the curious reader.

**For the Light-weight Resources and Providers (LWRPs) in Opscode's
public open source cookbooks, see [Opscode LWRP
Resources](Opscode%20LWRP%20Resources.html "Opscode LWRP Resources").**

File Locations
==============

Lightweight Resources and Providers are loaded from files in a
Cookbook's "resources" and "providers" directories. Resource and
Provider names combine the cookbook name and the file name with an
underscore. The only exception to this convention are files named
'default.rb'. In this case, the Resource or Provider is named according
to the cookbook name only.

### Examples

Note: there is no default LWRP for the AWS cookbook; they are referenced
only for illustrating how names correspond.
