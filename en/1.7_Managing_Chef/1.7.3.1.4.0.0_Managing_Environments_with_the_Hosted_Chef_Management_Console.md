### The Management Console can be used to manage environments.

-   Listing Environments
-   Viewing Environments
-   Creating Environments
-   Editing Environments
-   Modifying Environment Attributes
-   Adding a Node to an Environment
-   Deleting Environments

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and

In order to see other data in the environment, such as the nodes that
are members of it, you can select the environment from the drop down box
at the top of the page and then go to the relevant tab in the Management
Console:

For instance, to view nodes in the environment you could click on the
*Node* tab after selecting environment from the drop down. To view data
for all environments select *None* from the drop down. This can also get
set by clicking on the *Select* link next to an environment on the
*Environments* tab.

**Note:** You need [read
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the environment to view it.

Creating an Environment
-----------------------

The environment creation page allows you to create a new environment and

In order to create an environment:

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and navigate to the *Environments*
tab.

2. Click *Create* on the sub navigation bar.

3. Give the environment a name and an optional description

4. If necessary, add any cookbook version constraints by selecting the
cookbook name, operator, and entering the version number in the format
of x.y or x.y.z, and then click *add*.

5. If necessary, add environment attributes in the JSON attribute
editor. More information on using the JSON editor can be found in the
[next
section](#ManagingEnvironmentswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-ModifyingEnvironmentDefaultandOverrideAttributes).

6. Click *Create Environment*.

**Note:** You need [create
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global environments level to create an environment.

Editing an Environment
----------------------

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click *Environments* on the main navigation menu.

3. Click on the *edit* link next to the name of the environment you want
to edit.

4. On this page you can add any cookbook version constraints by
selecting the cookbook name, operator, and entering the version number
in the format of x.y or x.y.z, and then click *add*. You can also edit
the Attributes, which is described further below.

5. Click the *Create Environment* or *Update Environment* button when
you are done to save the environment.

Note: You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the environment to edit it.

### Modifying Environment Default and Override Attributes

You can edit the override [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") of
an environment, to override the values of an included recipe or role,
and you can edit the default attributes of an environment to specify
attributes that do not exist in included recipes and roles. You can use
the *Editor* or *Source* tabs on this page to edit the attributes. With
the *Editor* tab you can edit the attributes by selecting the location
on the tree and adding the details. You can use the *Source* tab to
paste in JSON directly.

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the environment to edit the attributes.

#### Using the *Editor* tab

1. Click on the plus sign next to "json" and select "default" or
"override" from the tree on the left, depending on the type of attribute
you want to create. If you're unsure, you should select "default" unless
you are trying to override a default attribute that is already set in
the node or in a recipe.

2. Click on the *Editor* tab on the right.

3. Push the green add button under the *Editor* tab:

4. Select a type of attribute from the drop down box. If you are unsure,
you most likely want "string" if the value is text, or "number" if the
value is a number.

5. Enter a name as the key and a body as the value and click *Add
Attribute*. The following figure shows the Default and Override
Attributes tree and the JSON editor.
