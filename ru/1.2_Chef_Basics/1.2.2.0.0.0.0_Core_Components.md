##### As you learn to use Chef, you'll need to understand what each of the different components are, and how they work together.   
  
 This page provides a brief overview of those components, and each has a more in-depth page.

  

Modeling Your Infrastructure
============================

### [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes")

A [node](Nodes.html "Nodes") is a host that runs the Chef client. The
primary features of a node, from Chef's point of view, are its
[attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") and its run list.
[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") are the thing that
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") and [Roles](Roles.html "Roles") are
applied to. You want to work with [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") any time
you want to:

-   Add a recipe to a system
-   Update an attribute

#### Run List

In the simplest case, the run list is a list of the
[recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") that a node will run. Assuming the
cookbook metadata is correct, you can put just the recipes you want to
run in the run list, and dependent recipes will be run automatically as
needed. Ordering is important: the order in which recipes are listed in
the run list is exactly the order in which chef will run them.

In more advanced usage, the run list will include
[roles](Roles.html "Roles") that a node has been assigned in addition to
any recipes set on the node explicitly. In this case, when the Chef
client runs, the run list is "expanded" into a list of recipes by
replacing the role's entry in the run list with the list of recipes the
role specifies in its run list.
