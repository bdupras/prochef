### Knife is a command-line tool that comes with Chef.

### It is used by administrators to interact with the Chef [Server API](Server%20API.html "Server API"), the local Chef repository and and can be used to manage the arbitrary stores of globally available JSON data known as [Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags").

#### Knife's `data bag` sub-command provides this capability.

-   For more information about Knife, refer to the
    **[Knife](Knife.html "Knife")** documentation.
-   See **[Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags")** for more
    information on Data Bags, and **[Encrypted Data
    Bags](Encrypted%20Data%20Bags.html "Encrypted Data Bags")** if the
    data stored in the data bags is sensitive and shouldn't be stored in
    plain text or viewable when checked into version control systems.

Managing Data Bags with Knife
-----------------------------

Data bags can be managed with the [knife command line
client](Knife.html "Knife"). Make sure you have correctly [configured
knife](Knife.html#Knife-Configuration) before trying the examples here.

### Creating Data Bags and Items

To create a data bag with knife, use

    knife data bag create BAG

For example, to create a data bag to store data about admins, run this
command:

    $ knife data bag create admins
    Created data_bag[admins]

Now that the data bag is created, you can put data items in it with
`knife data bag create BAG[ITEM]`. This command will create a skeleton
of the JSON for the data bag and drop you into your `$EDITOR` to edit
it.

To add an administrator to our admins data bag, we'd do the following:

    $ knife data bag create admins charlie

Now, in your editor, you'll see this:

    {
     "id": "charlie"
    }

To follow along with the example, edit the data bag item as follows:

    {
     "id": "charlie", 
     "uid": 1005, 
     "gid":"ops", 
     "shell":"/bin/zsh",
     "comment":"Crazy Charlie"
    }

When you exit your editor, knife will save this data to the server.

### Showing Data Bags and Items

To list all of the data bags on the server, use `knife data bag list`.
If you created the admins data bag above, running the command will
produce the following result:

    $ knife data bag list
      admins

To view the contents of a data bag, use `knife data bag show BAG`, for
example:

    $ knife data bag show admins
      charlie

To view the contents of a data bag item, use
`knife data bag show BAG ITEM`:

    $ knife data bag show admins charlie
    comment:  Crazy Charlie
    gid:      ops
    id:       charlie
    shell:    /bin/zsh
    uid:      1005

#### Create or Update Data Bag Items from JSON

To create or update a data bag item using a JSON file, use

    knife data bag from file BAG_NAME /path/to/file

If file is a relative or absolute path to the file, that file will be
used. Otherwise, the file parameter is treated as the base name of a
data bag file in a Chef repository, and knife will search for the file
in ./data\_bags/bag\_name/file. For example knife data bag from file
users dan.json would attempt to load the file
./data\_bags/users/dan.json. The JSON file in question should be a Hash
that contains at least an "id" key. The "id" key will be the item name.

    {
       "id": "item_name"
    }

Other keys can be added to this file just as they can when using
`knife data bag BAG_NAME ITEM_NAME create`.

### Editing Data Bag Items

Data bags are edited via knife with `knife data bag edit BAG ITEM`. This
works similarly to creating data bag items, loading your `$EDITOR` with
the data from the server, and saving it back to the server when you exit
the editor.

### Deleting Data Bags and Items

To delete a data bag with knife, use `knife data bag delete BAG`.
Individual data bag items are deleted with
`knife data bag delete BAG ITEM`.

**Deleting a Data Bag Item**

    $ knife data bag delete admins charlie
    Do you really want to delete charlie? (Y/N) Y
    Deleted data_bag_item[charlie]

**Deleting a Data Bag**

    $ knife data bag delete admins
    Do you really want to delete admins? (Y/N) Y
    Deleted data_bag[admins]

Encrypted data bags and knife
-----------------------------

The encrypted data bag features of the `knife data bag *` subcommands
are activated by specifying either a `--secret` or `--secret-file`
option.

-   `--secret SECRET` is used to specify the key used for encryption and
    decryption on the command line.
-   `--secret-file FILE` is used to specify the path to a file that
    contains the encryption/decryption key.

### Create a new encrypted data bag item

Verify that the data bag has been created and encrypted

### Decrypt an encrypted data bag item

### Other knife encrypted data bag commands

When given a `--secret` or `--secret-file` option,

-   `knife data bag from file` will **encrypt** the data bag item
    contained in the specified JSON file;
-   `knife data bag edit` will **decrypt** an existing data bag item,
    allow you to edit it, and then encrypt it before saving it to Chef
