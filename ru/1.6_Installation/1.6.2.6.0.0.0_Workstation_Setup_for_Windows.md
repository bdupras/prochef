Workstation Setup for Windows
=============================

  

#### This article explains how to setup a Chef Workstation on Windows.

##### A Chef workstation is where you develop cookbooks, and interact with your chef-server and nodes.

  
  

**Such a workstation typically includes:**

-   A local repository of your cookbooks and possibly other data.
-   A well-configured knife client

**To create such a workstation, this article explains how to:**

1.  Install Chef and Git
2.  Create a bare-bones chef repository
3.  Configure Knife

***Note:*** If you are using Hosted Chef with Windows 2008 R2 you can
use the [Fast Start Guide for
Windows](Fast%20Start%20Guide%20for%20Windows.html "Fast Start Guide for Windows")
for directions on setting up your node as a workstation and a client.
This guide also contains a quick walkthrough on using recipes on the
client.
