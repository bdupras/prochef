When you run chef-client, does it appear to run successfully, but when
you go to review the changes - none have been made?

One possible reason is that the chef-client had insufficient privileges.
See **[Running Chef Client with Elevated
Privileges](Running%20Chef%20Client%20with%20Elevated%20Privileges.html "Running Chef Client with Elevated Privileges")**
for how to address this.
