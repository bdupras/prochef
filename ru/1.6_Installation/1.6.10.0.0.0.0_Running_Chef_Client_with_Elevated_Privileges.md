Running Chef Client with Elevated Privileges
============================================

### Chef-client needs to run with elevated privileges to get most recipes to converge correctly.

##### On Unix and Unix-like operating systems this is done by running the command as root.

##### On Windows this is done by running command prompt as administrator.

 On Linux, you may see this error if you do not have the correct
permissions to run chef-client:

    $ chef-client
    [Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:46:17 -0800] INFO: *** Chef 10.X.X ***
    [Tue, 29 Nov 2011 19:46:18 -0800] WARN: Failed to read the private key /etc/chef/client.pem: #<Errno::EACCES: Permission denied - /etc/chef/client.pem>

You can resolve this by running the command as root. There are a few
ways you can accomplish this:

-   Logging in as root and running chef-client

-   Using su to become the root user and running chef-client:

        su
        chef-client

-   Using the `sudo` utility

        sudo chef-client

You could also resolve this by giving your user access to read /etc/chef
and the files accessed by chef-client, but *this is not advised as most
recipes will need super user privileges to complete correctly.*

Windows

 In Windows, this issue normally fails silently. **It appears that
chef-client converged correctly, but when you go to check the changes
they have not been made.**

If you see this occur, follow one of these options to run chef-client as
administrator and see if this resolves the issue.

-   Login into the Administrator account. **NOTE:** *This is different
    than an account in the Administrator's group.*

-   Run the chef-client process from the Administrator account while
    being logged into another account (you will be prompted for your
    Administrator password). You can do this by entering this command
    into a command prompt window:

        runas /user:Administrator "cmd /C chef-client"

-   Open a command prompt using UAC by right clicking on command prompt
    and selecting 'run as administrator':

Once the command prompt is open, you can run chef-client.
