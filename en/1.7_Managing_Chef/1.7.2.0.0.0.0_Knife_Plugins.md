**Opscode Knife Plugins**  
  
 See **[Launch Cloud Instances with
Knife](Launch%20Cloud%20Instances%20with%20Knife.html "Launch Cloud Instances with Knife")**
for detail on how to launch API-driven "Cloud" servers with Opscode
Knife Plugins and automatically run Chef on the launched servers.

Installing Plugins
------------------

**With Chef 0.10**, knife will load commands from the following
locations:

-   The core set of knife commands shipped with Chef
-   Commands in your home chef directory: \~/.chef/plugins/knife/
-   Commands in a .chef/plugins/knife/ directory in your cookbook repo
-   Commands located in a chef/knife/ directory in a Ruby Gem you have
    installed.

This allows you to conveniently keep a set of knife plugins that you
reuse across projects in your home directory, share plugins with your
team by including them in your cookbook repo, and share plugins with the
whole Chef community by distributing them as Ruby gems.

To install a knife plugin from a file, such as a gist on github or email
attachment, simply copy the file to your *\~/.chef/plugins/knife/*
directory. If you share a chef repo with your team and would like to
share the plugin, copy the file to CHEF\_REPO/.chef/plugins/knife/.

You can name the file anything you'd like as long as it's in this
directory and has a `.rb` extension. You can also have multiple classes
in one plugin file.

To use a plugin distributed as a rubygem, just install the gem.

Creating Plugins
----------------

Knife commands are Ruby classes that inherit from the Chef::Knife class.
Knife will load your command regardless of how it is namespaced, so it
is recommended that you put your commands in your own namespace. Knife
commands are run by calling the \`\#run\` method on an instance of your
command class. For example, here is a "hello, world" knife command:

**Notifying and Logging Resources with Knife Plugins**  
  
[Nuclear Rooster](http://dev.nuclearrooster.com/) did a nice blog post
on using **[Chef's flexible reporting handlers and knife
plugins](http://dev.nuclearrooster.com/2011/05/10/chef-notifying-and-logging-updated-resources/)**
for logging node updates, for easy debugging.

Is anyone reading this able to get that feature to work? I don't see
this implemented in the source anywhere...
