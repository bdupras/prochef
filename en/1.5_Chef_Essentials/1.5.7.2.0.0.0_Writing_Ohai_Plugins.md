### Need to Gather Additional Information About Your Infrastructure?

Ohai detects data about your operating system, and can be used
standalone. As it's primary purpose is to provide data to Chef, Ohai
itself is included with Chef. When invoked, Ohai collects detailed,
extensible information about the machine it's running on, including Chef
configuration, hostname, FQDN, networking, memory, CPU, platform, and
kernel data.

###### When used standalone, Ohai will print out a JSON data blob for all the known data about your system. That data is then available to you for whatever benefit you can derive through its use.

###### **If you'd like additional information about your system infrastructure - you could write your own Custom Ohai Plugin to gather that information for you.**

Create a simple plugin
----------------------

Ohai plugins use a ruby DSL  
 The following is about as simple as it gets:

    provides "orly"
    orly "yeah, rly."

Loading Your Plugin
-------------------

Create a "plugins" folder and put the above code in the
[plugins/orly.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/plugins/orly.rb)
file.

Now to fire up irb (I am assuming you are in the directory that contains
the "plugins" folder, if not adjust your path):

    >> require 'ohai'
    >> Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] << './plugins'
    >> o = Ohai::System.new
    >> o.all_plugins
    >> o.orly #=> "yea, rly"

The entire script can be found in
[orly.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/orly.rb).

If you run \`o.orly\` and get \`nil\` the chances are the plugin path is
probably incorrect. I battled with this for hours banging my head
against the wall. Turns out I just forgot the 's' on the end of
'./plugins'

Using a Mash
------------

Most of the information we want to lookup would be nested in some way,
and ohai tends to do this by storing the data in a Mash. This can be
done by creating a new mash and setting the attribute to it.

In
[plugins/canhas.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/plugins/canhaz.rb):

    provides "canhas"
    canhas Mash.new
    canhas[:burger] = "want"

Working with Different Platforms
--------------------------------

One of the main reasons for using ohai is to gather information
regardless of the operating system, luckily this is made easy by
optionally loading [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") based on the
platform. With that platform specific calls abstracted away you can keep
your code DRY.

The builtin plugins that come with ohai use the following trick to load
platform specific code:

It works by creating a base cross-platform plugin that loads the
platform specific plugin from a subdirectory. In
[plugins/lolcode.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/plugins/lolcode.rb):

    provides "languages/lolcode"
    require_plugin "languages"
    require_plugin "#{os}::lolcode"

    languages[:lolcode] = Mash.new unless languages[:lolcode]
    languages[:lolcode][:version] = "TEH VERSHIONS"

In
[plugins/darwin/lolcode.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/plugins/darwin/lolcode.rb):

    provides "languages/lolcode"
    require_plugin "languages"
    languages[:lolcode] = Mash.new unless languages[:lolcode]
    languages[:lolcode][:platform] = "MACKERS"

Checkout ohai's
[os.rb](http://github.com/opscode/ohai/blob/master/lib/ohai/plugins/os.rb)
for the list of platform names.

All of these examples can be found in the [ohai-plugin-howto github
repo](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/), you should be able
to clone that and run the ruby scripts in the repo's root directory. If
you figure out any other handy tricks please fork the project and add
them.

Extending an existing plugin
----------------------------

Ohai makes it very easy to extend a current plugin with new information.
Simply require the plugin you want to extend and extend away. In this
example we want to add LOLCODE to languages.

In
[plugins/lolcode.rb](http://github.com/csexton/ohai-plugin-howto/blob/master/plugins/lolcode.rb):

    provides "languages/lolcode"
    require_plugin "languages"
    languages[:lolcode] = Mash.new
    languages[:lolcode][:version] = "TEH VERSHIONS"

Chef Community Plugins
----------------------

Review (or contribute to) a collection of **[Community Plugins Found In
The Wild](Community%20Plugins.html "Community Plugins")**. You may find
a plugin created by someone in the community that fills a need. And if
you end up creating one that you believe may have appeal beyond your
infrastructure, please [contribute it to the
community](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute") for others as
well.

Loading and Distributing Custom Ohai Plugins
--------------------------------------------

**[Loading Custom Ohai
Plugins](Loading%20Custom%20Ohai%20Plugins.html "Loading Custom Ohai Plugins")**
provides detail on how to load a custom plugin to chef-client.
**[Distributing Ohai
Plugins](Distributing%20Ohai%20Plugins.html "Distributing Ohai Plugins")**
details how to distribute custom plugins to your
[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes").
