#### See Also:

-   [Search](Search.html "Search")

Infrastructure
==============

Applications run on Infrastructure. Infrastructure in this context isn't
physical or virtualized things like servers or networking. Rather,
infrastructure is the application itself, plus all the underlying
software prerequisites, server settings, tweaks, and configuration files
need for it to function properly. Infrastructure typically spans nodes,
and often networks.

#### See Also:

-   [Infrastructures.org](http://infrastructures.org)

JSON
====

Merb
====

Merb is a lightweight MVC framework used by the Chef
[Server](#Glossary-Server) to provide the [API](#Glossary-API) that
[clients](#Glossary-Client) communicate with.

#### See Also:

-   [Merb home page](http://www.merbivore.com/)

Metadata
========

Chef cookbooks use metadata to provide hints to the Chef
[Server](#Glossary-Server) about what cookbooks should be deployed to a
node, and can be used in user interfaces built on top of Chef.

#### See Also:

-   [Metadata](Metadata.html "Metadata")

Node
====

A node is a system that is configured by Chef.

#### See Also:

-   [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes")

supporting all the functionality of Chef and offered commercially by
Opscode.

#### See Also:

-   [Opscode Home Page](http://www.opscode.com)

Organization
============

In Hosted Chef, an organization represents a company, department or
other grouped set of servers [Infrastructure](#Glossary-Infrastructure)
managed by Chef.

#### See Also:

-   [Managing Organizations with the Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Managing%20Organizations%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Organizations with the Hosted Chef Management Console")

Platform
========

Chef detects the [Operating System](#Glossary-OperatingSystem) it is
running on through [Ohai](#Glossary-Ohai), and uses that platform
primarily to determine what [Provider](#Glossary-Provider) to use for
particular [resources](#Glossary-Resource).

Provider
========

A provider is an abstraction on top of system commands or API calls that
is used to configure a [Resource](#Glossary-Resource). Providers are
often [Operating System](#Glossary-OperatingSystem) specific, such as
the provider that installs packages for Debian (APT), Red Hat (Yum) or
ArchLinux (Pacman).

#### See Also:

-   [Providers](Providers.html "Providers")
-   [Lightweight Resources and Providers
    (LWRP)](Lightweight%20Resources%20and%20Providers%20(LWRP).html "Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP)")

Provision
=========

The act of installing an operating system on bare metal, virtual machine
or cloud computing instances is provisioning. Before Chef can
[configure](#Glossary-ConfigurationManagement) and
[integrate](#Glossary-SystemIntegration) systems, the system must first
be provisioned, and then [bootstrapped](#Glossary-Bootstrap). This
process varies by Operating System platform.

Queue
=====

The Chef [SOLR](#Glossary-SOLR) [Search](#Glossary-Search)
[Index](#Glossary-Index) uses a queue for incoming data that needs to be
indexed for search on the Chef [Server](#Glossary-Server).

#### See Also:

-   [Search](Search.html "Search")

Recipe
======

A recipe is a [Ruby](#Glossary-Ruby) [DSL](#Glossary-DSL) configuration
file that you write to encapsulate [resources](#Glossary-Resource) that
should be configured by Chef.

#### See Also:

-   [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes")

Repository
==========

A Chef Repository is a directory where you store all the various code
used to configure your infrastructure with Chef.

#### See Also:

-   [Chef Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository")

Resource
========

A resource is an abstraction that represents a particular thing that
needs to be configured, such as a package or a service.

#### See Also:

-   [Resources](Resources.html "Resources")
-   [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes")

REST
====

"REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software
architecture for distributed hypermedia systems," commonly associated
with HTTP. [APIs](#Glossary-API) conforming to REST constraints are
"RESTful". Chef uses a RESTful [API](#Glossary-API).

#### See Also:

-   [REST on
    Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)

Role

A role describes a set of functionality for nodes through
[recipes](#Glossary-Recipe) and [attributes](#Glossary-Attribute).

#### See Also:

-   [Roles](Roles.html "Roles")

Ruby
====

Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Chef is written in Ruby
and uses a number of Ruby [DSLs](#Glossary-DSL) for writing
[Recipe](#Glossary-Recipe), [Role](#Glossary-Role),
[Metadata](#Glossary-Metadata) as code.

#### See Also:

-   [Ruby Programming Language](http://ruby-lang.org)

Run List
========

A run list is an array of [recipes](#Glossary-Recipe) and
[roles](#Glossary-Role) that should be applied, in order, on the
[Node](#Glossary-Node), or in another [Role](#Glossary-Role).

#### See Also:

and can be queried with SOLR's Lucene search syntax.

#### See Also:

-   [Search](Search.html "Search")

Server
======

Shef
====

The Chef read-eval-print loop (REPL), Shef, is a way to run Chef in an
IRB session. IRB is an interactive Ruby console.

[recipes](#Glossary-Recipe) on [nodes](#Glossary-Node).

System Integration
==================

The act of making disparate systems in an
[Infrastructure](#Glossary-Infrastructure) work together to provide
application services and business value is system integration. It is
where all the systems that have been configured are brought together to
do their job.

Tags
====

Tags are an array [Attribute](#Glossary-Attribute) of
[nodes](#Glossary-Node).

#### See Also:

-   [Tags](Recipes.html#Recipes-Tags)

Template
========

Chef uses ERB templates to create dynamically generated configuration
files. The template files themselves are stored in
[cookbooks](#Glossary-Cookbook) and generated using the Erubis library
as it is faster than the default implementation of ERB in the Ruby
standard library.

#### See Also:

-   [Templates](Templates.html "Templates")
-   [Erubis home page](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/)
