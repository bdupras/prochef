Could use some examples of the query action of the mysql LWRP

Hi Robert,

I added an example of this to the wiki page above. Let us know if this
doesn't clear things up though.

The additional examples are great. I was originally and still wondering
with the mysql "query a database", is there a way to get the results of
the query?

Hi Robert,

It doesn't look like this is possible with LWRP, but you could do this
with the mysql library. This post goes over this in more detail:
[http://blog.loftninjas.org/2011/02/16/the-power-of-chef-and-ruby/](http://blog.loftninjas.org/2011/02/16/the-power-of-chef-and-ruby/)
It's basically just explaining how to use the Ruby mysql library. More
information on it can also be found here:
[http://tmtm.org/en/ruby/mysql/](http://tmtm.org/en/ruby/mysql/)

So, you could do something like this with this library:

    data = m.query("SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE")

According to that Ruby link this would automatically invoke
store\_result() and return Mysql::Result object when a result is
returned. If query does not return a result, it returns nil. So you
could get the data from this variable with something that iterates
through the variable like this:

    data.each { |row| puts row }

Hope this helps.

I try this example:  
 python\_pip "django" do  
 version "1.1.4"  
 action :install  
 end  
 and it says:  
 ERROR: NameError: Cannot find a resource for python\_pip on ubuntu
version 12.04

How do I solve this?  
 Thanks

William: "python\_pip is dependent on python cookbook - so don't forget
to include it in your metadata file in your cookbook."

I had a similar problem on the latest Ubuntu - 12.04. Even though I
added Python cookbook - which in turn was dependent on some other
cookbook, I was still getting errors.Eventually I ended up with a
workaround as I didn't really have much time to investigate - I wrote my
own pip LWRP. Have a look here:
