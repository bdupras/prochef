Headless Branches for Cookbook Repositories
===========================================

### While Opscode isn't using this method for our own [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks"), other people in the community who wish to collaborate and share cookbooks may be interested in this technique.

  

###### *From the README.markdown in Community Member [Tim Dysinger's repository](http://github.com/dysinger/cookbooks/tree/master)*

  
 Instead of one big cookbooks dir to rule them all, you can merge in the
branches you would like into your main git-based cookbooks repo.

  
 Create a new cookbook repo

    cd /my/teh/awesome/projects
    mkdir cookbooks
    cd cookbooks
    git init
    touch .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"

Add this to your $HOME/.gitconfig

    [alias]
            headless = !sh -c 'git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/$0 && rm .git/index && git clean -fdx'

Create a new headless branch for your own recipe

    git stash
    git headless my-new-recipe
    touch .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git push origin my-new-recipe

Fork a recipe from someone else and work on it

    git stash
    git remote add elsewhere git://github.com/XXX/cookbooks.git
    git remote update
    git checkout -b milkshake elsewhere/milkshake ; # & work work work
    git commit -a -m "Changed some stuff"
    git push origin milkshake

You can share a branch with multiple related recipes to make it easy for
others

    git stash
    git headless my-new-shared-cookbook
    touch .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git branch ; # list all the recipes
    git merge my-1st-recipe
    git merge my-2nd-recipe ; # needed by the 1st
    git merge my-3rd-recipe ; # needed by the 2nd
    git push origin my-new-shared-cookbook

You can create a new headless branch for each of your clusters you
manage

    git stash
    git headless my-new-cluster-cookbook
    touch .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git branch ; # list all the recipes
    git merge git
    git merge apache2
    git merge couchdb
    git merge erlang
    git push mycluster my-new-cluster-cookbook
