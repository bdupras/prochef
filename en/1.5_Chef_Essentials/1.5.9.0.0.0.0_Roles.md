Roles
=====

Overview
========

#### A role provides a means of grouping similar features of similar nodes, providing a mechanism for easily composing sets of functionality.

#### At web scale, you almost never have just one of something, so you use roles to express the parts of the configuration that are shared by a group of [Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes").

##### ![image](../attachments/1835338/14057523.gif) Roles consist of the same parts as a node: [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") and a [Run List](#Roles-runlist).

##### ![image](../attachments/1835338/14057523.gif) Nodes can have multiple roles applied, and they will be expanded in place, providing for a complete recipe list for that node.

##### ![image](../attachments/1835338/14057523.gif) When the Chef client runs, it merges its own attributes and run list with those of any roles it has been assigned.

  
 For example, let's say I have a list of
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") that should be applied on all my
Ubuntu servers, and a list that is specific to machines that are Web
Servers. This would map cleanly to two roles: 'ubuntu' and
'web\_server'.

Each role would specify the list of recipes it requires, in the order
they should be applied. Where there is overlap (i.e., a recipe appears
twice) it will be run when the first role is expanded (not run twice.)

  
**You can create roles in Chef in 4 different ways:**

1.  through the creation of role files in your chef repository (that
    utilize a ruby DSL, which gets compiled to JSON,)
2.  the creation of the JSON files directly in your chef repository,
3.  through [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") or the [Open Source Chef Server
    Management
    Console](Open%20Source%20Chef%20Server%20Management%20Console.html "Open Source Chef Server Management Console"),
4.  or through the REST API.

Once you have created a role, you can add it to a node through the
[Management Console](Management%20Console.html "Management Console") by
dragging it from the Roles list to the client's "run list", you can use
the Chef command line tool [Knife](Knife.html "Knife"), or you can [add
it with a JSON
file](Setting%20the%20run_list%20in%20JSON%20during%20run%20time.html "Setting the run_list in JSON during run time").

**Roles work with chef-solo too!**  
You can use Roles with Chef Solo as well as the Client/Server. See the
[Chef Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo") documentation.

I like the idea of roles, but I can't quite wrap my mind around some of
the implementation here. There seems to be a global roles namespace
(actually "global" isn't really defined either). Also, why do you put a
role spec into a cookbook? I'd expect most roles to straddle cookbooks
(else might as well create a recipe). In the end, which roles exist in
the role namespace when a node starts? All this seems very ill-defined.

On implementing roles, how would the following differ from what you
describe? Create a "roles" cookbook. Create a recipe for each role. The
recipe munges the attributes (to implement the default/override) and
then includes each recipe used for the role in turn. Is what you propose
different? Is is syntactic sugar? Does it have different semantics?

Another question your role ruby DSL brought up is what "rake install"
does. I haven't looked into it, but it seems to actively push data to a
specific chef server. That seems to conteract the ability to publish
cookbook libraries on github or similar public access repositories. It
seems to me that a chef server should always extract information from
files in the cookbook, and if a cookbook is updated, we may want to have
ways to ping a chef server (or multiple) but that they should then come
back and actively fetch the updated content. At least that's the way
we've been planning to operate.

The roles are not tied to cookbooks - they are totally separate entities
(and have their own namespace entirely.) Roles definitely straddle
cookbooks. The 'roles' directory we talk about above is a top-level item
in the chef-repo:

/roles  
 /cookbooks  
 /site-cookbooks

And so on.

You could get similar functionality from using a 'roles' cookbook, in
that you can have a recipe that performs an 'include\_recipe' for each,
and attribute files that implement something akin to default/override.
The role concept is a higher-level abstraction, in that it exists
outside of a given cookbook, can be distributed on it's own, and can be
used to reason about the set of included recipes that will be run on the
node (we'll still miss things that are dynamically included, but the
final recipe list is still easier to grok if you compose it via roles.)

See above for your question about roles/cookbooks. When you run 'rake
install', we create JSON representations of the role, and then load that
in to the chef-server (in the same way you would by using the REST API,
basically.) You can absolutely bring in the role data from external
sources (eventually, this would be one of the things you can do with a
shared community website.)

Ah, I missed that the roles dir is at the top of the repo, not the
cookbook. Thanks for clarifying. I'm still not entirely clear on the
roles namespace. The cookbook namespace is defined by the search path
through repos (or directories). Is the roles namespace similarly
defined?

This may seem obvious to most, but it just bit me now, and error logs
weren't immediately obvious to me, simply returning a "Failed loading
ChefServerSlice (409 "Conflict")" error.

When loading in roles from the filesystem, a role's filename (without
the filetype extension) and the role name inside the file must be the
same, so example\_server.json must have the name value listed like so:
"name": "example\_server".

The first role with a mismatching name/filename combo will stop the
subsequent roles being loaded, even if their names do match up as
required.

A syntax comment - It was unclear to me how to override multiple
attributes using the Ruby DSL. After a bit of experimentation, I updated
the docs above with an example. It works but seems a bit weird to me -
you're making a hash without the open and close braces where the first
key needs to be on the same line as the "override\_attributes" method (I
assume it's the same with default\_attributes).

Has there been any though on changing the syntax to match that in the
attributes files?  
 e.g. override:apache2:max\_children = "2"

I agree with Michael Leinartas. I find that I have to create a
superfluous cookbook to go with some roles just so I can use the
cookbook style attribute. In many cases I want to have one attribute
combine earlier attributes, like building paths, or like:  
`set:users:sudoers=%w(foo bar)`  
`set:users:login_names = users:sudoers + %w(buz joe)`

(Noticed that my markup was wrong and my intent wasn't being shown.
Fixed now)

This is just plain Ruby, but Ruby's flexibility makes it a little
confusing if you're not used to it. `override_attributes` is a method
call, and Ruby allows you to omit parentheses and also pass a hash as
the final parameter to a method without surrounding it in braces if it's
not ambiguous to the parser. In other words, you could add parens and
write your example something like this if you find it clearer (I do):

    override_attributes(
      :apache2 => {
        :prefork => { :min_spareservers => "5" }
      },
      :tomcat => {
        :worker_threads => "100"
      }
    )

I'll update your example in the wiki, since it seems like the next
commenter has a similar question.

I've just updated the text and examples following my comment to Michael
above â€“ see if that helps for your desired use case

Ches, that clarifies some things, but not as far as I can tell, my
question which is can I avoid having to create a matching
cookbook/recipe to be able to build up attributes in a role from
elements of other attributes that are also part of the
override\_attributes method.

I presume I can not say:

    override_attributes(
      :apache2 => {
        :prefork => { :min_spareservers => 5 }
      },
      :tomcat => {
        :worker_threads => 20 * node[:apache2][:prefork][:min_spareservers]
      }
    )

Is there a way to accomplish something like that (use an attibute tha
was defined earlier in the same override\_attributes method) within a
role file?
