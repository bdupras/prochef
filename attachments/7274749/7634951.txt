Thank you for your interest in an OpsCode, Inc. (the "Company"), Open Source Project.  In 
order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or 
entity, the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been 
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.  This license is for 
your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Company and its users; it does 
not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.  This version of the 
Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the Company, to 
authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the Company, and to grant 
copyright and patent licenses and other rights with respect thereto.  If you have not already done 
so, please complete and send an original signed Agreement to 2311 North 45th St, Suite 190, 
Seattle, WA, 98103, U.S.A.  If necessary, you may send it by facsimile to the Company at +1-
206-508-4759, or scan and e-mail it to legal@opscode.com.  Please read this document carefully 
before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future 
Contributions submitted to the Company.  Except for the license and other rights granted herein 
to the Company and recipients of software, products or services distributed or provided directly 
or indirectly by, through or under the Company, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to 
Your Contributions.


1.	Definitions.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the 
copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Company.  For legal entities, the 
entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are 
under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.  For the 
purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or 
(ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial 
ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship 
expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as any original work of authorship, including 
any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You 
to the Company for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the software, products or 
services of the Company (the "Work").  For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Company or 
its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, 
source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the Company for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in 
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2.	Grant of Copyright License.  You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of any 
software, products or services distributed or provided directly or indirectly by, through or 
under the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable copyright license to (directly or through others) reproduce, prepare derivative 
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your 
Contributions and such derivative works.

3.	Grant of Patent License.  You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of any 
software, products or services distributed or provided directly or indirectly by, through or 
under the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to (directly or through others) 
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your 
Contributions and/or any resulting Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or 
by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) 
were submitted.  If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or 
the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that 
Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.	You agree that all Contributions are and will be given entirely voluntarily.  Company will 
not be required to use, or to refrain from using, any Contributions that You may submit to 
Company.  Contributions, even if designated as confidential by You, will not, absent a 
separate written agreement signed by Company, create any confidentiality obligation of 
Company, and Company has not undertaken any obligation to treat any Contributions or 
other information You have given Company or will give Company in the future as 
confidential or proprietary information.  Furthermore, except as otherwise provided in a 
separate subsequent written agreement between You and Company, Company will be 
free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the 
Contributions as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on 
account of any proprietary or intellectual property rights or otherwise.

5.	You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses and other rights.  
You represent further that each employee of the Corporation designated on Schedule A 
below (or in a subsequent written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit 
Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

6.	You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for 
submissions on behalf of others).

7.	You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You 
desire to provide support.  You may provide support to others for free, for a fee, or not at 
all.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing (including, without 
limitation, the express representations made by You in this Agreement), You provide 
Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8.	Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to 
the Company separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its 
source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related 
patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and 
conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

9.	It is Your responsibility to notify the Company when any change is required to the list of 
designated employees authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or 
to the Corporation's Point of Contact with the Company.

10.	The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and 
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Washington applicable to 
agreements made there (excluding the conflicts of laws rules).  This Agreement embodies 
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes any and all 
prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the matters provided for 
herein.  No alteration, waiver, amendment, change or supplement hereto shall be binding 
or effective unless the same is set forth in writing signed by both parties.
