#### Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef

Community member [Stephen Nelson-Smith](http://agilesysadmin.net/) has
written **[Test-Driven Infrastructure with
Chef](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020042)**.

He demonstrates a radical approach to developing web infrastructure that
combines the powerful Chef configuration management framework with
Cucumber, the leading Behavior-driven development (BDD) tool. Learn how
developing code test-first allows you to make significant changes
without the fear of unexpected side effects.

Lesson Plan
-----------

![image](../attachments/1179727/20840545.jpg)

You want to learn more about Chef? We want to teach you about Chef! *How
convenient!* Lets start at the top, shall we?

#### [Fast Start Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide")

Head over to the [Fast Start
Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide"), which will walk
you through the following:

-   Install Chef on your local workstation
-   Set up a Chef Repository for storing your cookbooks and other
    "infrastructure as code."
-   Download a cookbook for managing a new Chef Node.

It takes a few assumptions to get you up and running as quickly as
possible.

#### [Chef Basics](Chef%20Basics.html "Chef Basics")

Learn some of the central concepts of configuration management benefits
for your infrastructure.

1.  We begin with an [Architecture
    Introduction](Architecture%20Introduction.html "Architecture Introduction"),
    covering the basic functions of the Chef Server, Nodes, and Chef
    Workstations and how these components communicate.
2.  Then an overview of the [Core
    Components](Core%20Components.html "Core Components"), which
    introduces all of the aspects and components of modeling your
    infrastructure, Configuring Nodes and Managing Chef.
3.  Onward to Cooking School and begin an [Introduction to Cookbooks and
    More](Introduction%20to%20Cookbooks%20and%20More.html "Introduction to Cookbooks and More").
    Cookbooks are Chef's fundamental units of distribution, the way Chef
    users package up, distribute and share configuration information.
    Recipes, Resources, Attributes, Roles and more are also introduced.
4.  The final basic section is an [Introduction to Search and Data
    Bags](Introduction%20to%20Search%20and%20Data%20Bags.html "Introduction to Search and Data Bags"),
    two of Chef's most powerful features allowing you to dynamically
    change the configuration of your infrastructure based on data.

#### [Chef Architecture](Architecture.html "Architecture")

With all that under your belt, it's time to tackle the dirty secrets of
what's happening behind the scenes with [Chef
Architecture](Architecture.html "Architecture"). We'll give you the
scoop on Chef's [Authentication and
Authorization](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization")
system and go over the [Anatomy of a Chef
Run](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run"), where
we go in-depth with the process by which your systems get configured.
From there we'll review all the executable parts of Chef - [Chef
Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client"), [Chef
Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo"), [Chef
Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server"), [Chef
Indexer](Chef%20Indexer.html "Chef Indexer"), and [Server
API](Server%20API.html "Server API") and [Cookbook Site
API](Cookbook%20Site%20API.html "Cookbook Site API") interaction.
