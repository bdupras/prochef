Opscode Apt Repository Excerpt
==============================

This page serves as an excerpt to be included on other pages so we have
["DRY" docs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drydock).

To add it to a page, use:

Add the Opscode APT Repository
------------------------------

Create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list`.

**/etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list**

    deb http://apt.opscode.com/ <codename> main

-   For Chef 0.9.x, replace codename with the supported distribution
    codename, such as "lucid".
-   For Chef 0.10.x, replace codename with the codename, suffixed with
    "-0.10", for example, "lucid-0.10".

If you would like to be able to download source packages, add an
additional identical line, but change `deb` to `deb-src` line.

You can copy and paste these examples to create the necessary
sources.list entry:

**Ubuntu for Chef 0.9.x**

    echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -cs` main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list

**Ubuntu for Chef 0.10.x**

    echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -cs`-0.10 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list

Debian users will likely need to run 'apt-get install sudo wget
lsb-release' as root before pasting the examples.

Add the GPG Key and Update Index
--------------------------------

Before you install the packages, make sure you add the Opscode GPG key
to apt.

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 83EF826A
    gpg --export packages@opscode.com | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/opscode-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

**Issues downloading from gnupg.net?**  
If you get an error when trying to download the key that states that the
"keyserver timed out", try downloading the key directly from our apt
repository instead:

    gpg --fetch-key http://apt.opscode.com/packages@opscode.com.gpg.key

Afterwards you'll also want to run this command again:

    gpg --export packages@opscode.com | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/opscode-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Now, we update apt-get with the newly added Opscode repository:

    sudo apt-get update

Installing the opscode-keyring package will keep the key up-to-date:

    sudo apt-get install opscode-keyring # permanent upgradeable keyring

Upgrade Existing Packages
-------------------------

To ensure you are using the latest versions of libraries that chef
depends on, you may wish to update your existing packages:

    sudo apt-get upgrade
