File Distribution
=================

Distribution
============

##### Often, you need to distribute files to your servers. The Files within a [cookbook](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") are where you can do just that.

##### They are reached via the [cookbook\_file resource](Resources.html#Resources-CookbookFile).

  

**A cookbook\_file resource**

    cookbook_file "/usr/local/bin/apache2_module_conf_generate.pl" do
      source "apache2_module_conf_generate.pl"
      mode 0755
      owner "root"
      group "root"
    end

The above resource would create
`/usr/local/bin/apache2_module_conf_generate.pl` from the
`apache2_module_conf_generate.pl` file contained in the cookbook that
was most specific to the Node executing the
[recipe](Recipes.html "Recipes"). By default, it looks for [File
Specificity](#FileDistribution-FileSpecificity) from the remote\_url
setting in the Client configuration.

File Specificity
----------------

[Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") will work on multiple platforms
frequently, or distribute files that are only subtly different depending
on the platform. Chef Cookbooks allow you to only specify those files
one time, but make sure that the right file ends up on each system.
Within a Cookbook's `files` or `templates` directories, you might find a
directory structure like this:

-   files/ (or templates/)
    -   host-foo.example.com
    -   ubuntu-8.04
    -   ubuntu-8
    -   ubuntu
    -   default

Given this resource:

**A cookbook\_file resource**

    cookbook_file "/usr/local/bin/apache2_module_conf_generate.pl" do
      source "apache2_module_conf_generate.pl"
      mode 0755
      owner "root"
      group "root"
    end

We would match:

-   host-foo.example.com/apache2\_module\_conf\_generate.pl
-   ubuntu-8.04/apache2\_module\_conf\_generate.pl
-   ubuntu-8/apache2\_module\_conf\_generate.pl
-   ubuntu/apache2\_module\_conf\_generate.pl
-   default/apache2\_module\_conf\_generate.pl

In that order (given a Node named foo.example.com running Ubuntu 8.04).
Then for example, if we put `apache_module_conf_generate.pl` under
`files/host-foo.example.com/` directory it will be only copied to the
machine with the domain name `foo.example.com`.

So, the rule distilled:

1.  `host-node[:fqdn]`
2.  `node[:platform]-node[:version]`
3.  `node[:platform]-version_components`: The version string is split on
    decimals and searched from greatest specificity to least; for
    example, if the location from the last rule was centos-5.7.1, then
    centos-5.7 and centos-5 would also be searched.
4.  `node[:platform]`
5.  `default`

**0.10.6**  
The searching of version components (e.g. searching centos-5 in addition
to centos-5.6) was added in Chef 0.10.6.

**Host Notation**  
The **host-** is literal. If your host was `foo.example.com`, then your
folder needs to be named `host-foo.example.com`.

This is inspired by Single Copy Nirvana - if you think about it that
way, this will click immediately.

When does a file get transferred?
---------------------------------

When you run a cookbook\_file resource, the client will calculate the
checksum of local file. It compares this checksum against the checksum
of the most specific available version of the file in the cookbook. If
the checksums match, the file will not be transferred. Additionally,
cookbook files are loaded lazily from the server--a cookbook may contain
many cookbook files, but they are only transferred to the client as they
are needed.   
  
  
  

  

Good Morning,

I would like to do next things:  
 1) Create a sql file that contain the creation of database  
 2) This file put into the files directory, is it correct? is it
possible?  
 3) In a recipe file call execute this file that generate the database,
is it possible? How to do?

Best Regards,  
 Javier

Does the cookbook\_file follow symlinks? I've got several hosts that
need the same config for some cookbook\_files. I'd really like to make
one copy of this and symlink all the other host directories off of it,
but this doesn't seem to work.
