Making Authenticated API Requests
=================================

  

![image](../attachments/19071696/20611118.png)   

### This is a technical description of the authentication method used when API clients make requests to the Chef Server

##### 

For a broad overview of the authentication process see **[Authentication
and
Authorization](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization")**

Protocol Overview
-----------------

Authentication occurs by constructing a specific set of HTTP headers,
and then signing a subset of those headers and information about the
request using the API client's private key. The server verifies the
signature using the public key of the specified API client.

**API Calls against Hosted Chef**  
  
 API calls against Hosted Chef must also include the header
**X-Chef-Version** which should be set to the version of the Chef
executable making the API call. Practically, this controls whether you
will receive API responses in the form expected by 0.9.x or 0.10.x.   

### Required Authentication Headers

Every API request must contain the following headers:

-   **X-Ops-Timestamp**: A timestamp in
    [ISO-8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874)
    format. The time must be in UTC, indicated by a trailing Z, and
    separated by the character "T". The following is an example of a
    time in this format:

        2011-10-14T18:17:48Z

-   **X-Ops-UserId**: The name of the API client whose private key will
    be used to create the authorization header.
-   **X-Ops-Content-Hash**: The body of the request, hashed using SHA1
    and encoded using Base64. See Hashing below.
-   **X-Ops-Sign**: Set to "version=1.0"
-   **X-Ops-Authorization-N**: One or more headers whose value are the
    signature of the "canonical headers", encoded in Base64. See
    **Canonical Headers** and **X-Ops-Authorization Headers** below.

Note, that these are the headers required for authentication. Other
headers such as "Accept" should also be included in your request.

### Canonical Headers

The **Canonical Header** is a string in the following format:

    "Method:HTTP_METHOD\nHashed Path:HASHED_PATH\nX-Ops-Content-Hash:HASHED_BODY\nX-Ops-Timestamp:TIME\nX-Ops-UserId:USERID"

HTTP\_METHOD is the method being used in the API request (e.g., GET or
POST) and must be capitalized. HASHED\_PATH is the path of the request
(e.g., "/clients" on Open Source Chef or
"/organizations/ORGNAME/clients" on Hosted Chef) hashed with SHA1 and
encoded using Base64 (see **Hashing**). The path **must not** have
repeated "/"s and **must not** end in a "/", unless the path is "/".

### Hashing

All Hashing is done using SHA1 and encoded in Base64. The Base64
encoding should have line breaks every 60 characters.

### X-Ops-Authorization Headers

To create the **Authorization Headers**, the canonical header is signed
with the API client's private key and encoded using Base64. The private
key must be an RSA key in SSL's PEM format. This signature is then
broken in into 60 character strings and placed in the headers
**X-Ops-Authorization-1** through **X-Ops-Authorization-N** where N is
the last header needed to send the entire string.

The Chef server decrypts the X-Ops-Authorization headers and ensures
their content matches the content of the non-encrypted headers that were
sent. Further, the timestamp of the message is checked to ensure that
the request has been received within a reasonable amount of time.

Within Chef, this authorization method is implemented by
[mixlib-authentication](https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-authentication).

Making API Requests in Ruby

### From a Knife Plugin or Knife Exec script

When creating a Knife Plugin or Knife Exec script, the libraries
required to make authenticated API requests have already been included.
In the most cases, one will not need to make API calls directly when
using knife plugins or knife exec scripts, as it is easier to interact
with nodes, clients, and other objects via other means. See the **[Knife
Plugins](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins")** and **[Knife
Exec](Knife%20Exec.html "Knife Exec")** page for details.

In a Knife Exec script (and Shef), the `api` object already includes all
of the necessary configuration to make API calls using the following
methods:

    api.get
    api.post
    api.put
    api.delete

**API Request from a Knife Exec Script, Example 1**

    knife exec -E 'puts api.get("/nodes/nodename")'

**API Request from a Knife Exec Script, Example 2**

    client_desc = {
      "name"  => "monkeypants",
      "admin" => false
    }
    new_client = api.post("/clients", client_desc)
    puts new_client["private_key"]

Moreover, whenever possible, `api` will return an object of the relevant
type, on which you can call methods.

**API Request from a Knife Exec Script, Example 2**

    # We could also just call api.delete, but that wouldn't show 
    # that api returns a node object
    silly_node = api.get("/nodes/foobar")
    silly_node.destroy

In a Knife Plugin, the `rest` object is similar to the `api` client. The
only difference is the function names:

    rest.get_rest
    rest.put_rest
    rest.post_rest
    rest.delete_rest

**API Request from a Knife Plugin**

    module MyCommands
      class MyNodeDelete < Chef::Knife
        #An implementation of knife node delete
        banner 'knife my node delete [NODE_NAME]'
        
        def run
          if name_args.length < 1
            show_usage
            ui.fatal("You must specify a node name.")
            exit 1
          end
          nodename = name_args[0]
          api_endpoint = "nodes/#{nodename}"
          # Again, we could just call rest.delete_rest
          nodey = rest.get_rest(api_endpoint)
          ui.confirm("Do you really want to delete #{nodey}")
          nodey.destroy
        end
      end
    end

Note that knife will handle any HTTP exceptions that arise within your
knife plugin or exec script.

### Arbitrary Ruby Scripts

On a system with Chef installed, the easiest way to make authenticated
API request is to use the chef libraries.

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'chef/config'
    require 'chef/log'
    require 'chef/rest'

    chef_server_url="https://chefserver.com"
    client_name = "clientname"
    signing_key_filename="/path/to/pem/for/clientname"

    rest = Chef::REST.new(chef_server_url, client_name, signing_key_filename)
    puts rest.get_rest("/clients")

Another example of using the Chef library to make API requests

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'mixlib/cli'
    require 'chef'
    require 'chef/node'
    require 'chef/mixin/xml_escape'
    require 'json'
     
    config_file = "c:/chef/client.rb"
    Chef::Config.from_file(config_file)
    Chef::Log.level = Chef::Config[:log_level]


    def Usage()
      puts "Enter configuration file location. e.g. c:/chef/client.rb or /etc/chef/client.rb or ~/home/.chef/knife.rb etc."
      config_file = gets.chomp
      if (!File.exists?(config_file))
          puts "config_file #{config_file} does not exist. Exiting.\n"
          exit
      end
      STDOUT.puts <<-EOF
    Choose options e.g. 1

      1 Display all nodes per environment
      2 Display all nodes in detail (can be slow if there a large number of nodes)
      9 Exit
      EOF
    end

    def ExecuteUserChoice()
      testoption = gets.chomp
      case testoption 
      when "1"
        Execute(method(:DisplayNodesPerEnv))
      when "2"
        Execute(method(:DisplayNodesDetail))
      when "9"
        puts "exit"
      else
       puts "Unknown option #{testoption}. Exiting\n"
       exit
      end
    end

    def DisplayNodesPerEnv()
      Chef::Environment.list(false).each do |envr|
        print "ENVIRONMENT: ", envr[0], "\n"
        Chef::Node.list_by_environment(envr[0], false).each do |node_info|
          print "\tNODE: ", node_info[0], "\n"
          print "\t\tURL: ", node_info[1], "\n"
        end
      end
    end

    def DisplayNodesDetail()
      Chef::Node.list(true).each do |node_array|
        node = node_array[1]
        print "#{node.name}\n"
        print "\t#{node[:fqdn]}\n"
        print "\t#{node[:kernel][:machine]}\n"
        print "\t#{node[:kernel][:os]}\n"
        print "\t#{node[:platform]}\n"
        print "\t#{node[:platform_version]}\n"
        print "\t#{node.chef_environment}\n"
        print "\t#{node.run_list.roles}\n"
      end
    end
        
    def Execute(option)
      begin
        profilestart = Time.now
        option.call()
        profileend = Time.now
        timeofrun = profileend - profilestart
        print "Time taken = #{timeofrun}"
      rescue Exception => ex
        print "Error calling chef API"
        print ex.message
        print ex.backtrace.join("\n")
      end
    end

    Usage()
    ExecuteUserChoice()

Making API Requests in Python
-----------------------------

![image](images/icons/emoticons/information.gif)

**Python API for Interacting with Chef Server**  
![image](../attachments/19071696/20611119.png)  
 Opscode team member [Noah Kantrowitz](http://coderanger.net/) has
constructed **[PyChef](https://github.com/coderanger/pychef)**: a Python
library satisfying the Mixlib::Authentication pre-requisites, for
interacting with the Chef Server.   

  
As with [Knife Plugins](Knife%20Plugins.html "Knife Plugins") and [Knife
Exec](Knife%20Exec.html "Knife Exec") scripts, you will typically not
want to make API calls directly, but use other facilities provided by
the library.

For example, the following is the example provided in PyChef's README:

    from chef import autoconfigure, Node

    api = autoconfigure()
    n = Node('web1')
    print n['fqdn']
    n['myapp']['version'] = '1.0'
    n.save()

However, it is also possible to make API calls directly:

    from chef import autoconfigure

    api = autoconfigure()
    print api.api_request('GET', '/clients')

*Note: Both of these examples assume that your current working directory
is such that PyChef can find a valid chef configuration file in the same
manner chef-client or knife would find its configuration.*

Making API Requests with Curl
-----------------------------

![image](../attachments/19071696/20611121.png)

It is also possible to make authenticated API requests using `curl` or
`wget` provided you have various common tools installed.   
 The following is an example of how one can create an authenticated
request using curl. It is a Bash shell script which requires the
following utilities: awk, openssl

    _chef_dir () {
        # Helper function:
        # Recursive function that searches for chef configuration directory
        # It looks upward from the cwd until it hits /.  If no directory is found,
        # ~/.chef is chosen if it exists
        # You could simply hard-code the path below

        if [ "$PWD" = "/" ]; then
            if [ -d ".chef" ]; then
                echo "/.chef"
            elif [ -d "$HOME/.chef" ]; then
                echo "$HOME/.chef"
            fi
            return
        fi

        if [ -d '.chef' ];then
            echo "${PWD}/.chef"
        else
            (cd ..; _chef_dir)
        fi
    }


    _chomp () {
        # helper function to remove newlines
        awk '{printf "%s", $0}'
    }

    chef_api_request() {
        # This is the meat-and-potatoes, or rice-and-vegetables, your preference really.

        local method path body timestamp chef_server_url client_name hashed_body hashed_path
        local canonical_request headers auth_headers

        chef_server_url="https://api.opscode.com/organizations/paul-opscode"
        # '/organizations/ORG_NAME' is needed for Hosted Chef
        if echo $chef_server_url | grep -q "https://api.opscode.com" ; then
            endpoint=/${chef_server_url##https://api.opscode.com/}$2
        else
            endpoint=$2
        fi
        path=${chef_server_url}$2
        client_name="pmooring"
        method=$1
        body=$3

        hashed_path=$(echo -n "$endpoint" | openssl dgst -sha1 -binary | openssl enc -base64)
        hashed_body=$(echo -n "$body" | openssl dgst -sha1 -binary | openssl enc -base64)
        timestamp=$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

        canonical_request="Method:$method\nHashed Path:$hashed_path\nX-Ops-Content-Hash:$hashed_body\nX-Ops-Timestamp:$timestamp\nX-Ops-UserId:$client_name"
        headers="-H X-Ops-Timestamp:$timestamp -H X-Ops-Userid:$client_name -H X-Chef-Version:0.10.4 -H Accept:application/json -H X-Ops-Content-Hash:$hashed_body -H X-Ops-Sign:version=1.0"

        auth_headers=$(printf "$canonical_request" | openssl rsautl -sign -inkey "$(_chef_dir)/${client_name}.pem" | openssl enc -base64 | _chomp |  awk '{ll=int(length/60);i=0; while (i<=ll) {printf " -H X-Ops-Authorization-%s:%s", i+1, substr($0,i*60+1,60);i=i+1}}')

        case $method in
            GET)
                curl_command="curl $headers $auth_headers $path"
                $curl_command
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Unknown Method. I only know: GET" >&2
                return 1
                ;;
        esac

    }

After sourcing this shell script into your local shell, you might use it
as follows:

    chef_api_request GET "/clients"
