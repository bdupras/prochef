Upgrading Chef 0.9.x to Chef 10.x
=================================

Before Upgrading
================

Before upgrading, make sure you have backups that you can recover from.
When you're ready to proceed, stop the chef-server, chef-server-webui,
chef-solr, and chef-solr-indexer on the server, and chef-client on the
clients.

    for svc in server server-webui solr solr-indexer
    do
      sudo /etc/init.d/chef-${svc} stop
    done

    # client only:
    sudo /etc/init.d/chef-client stop

Make sure the 'merb' processes for the chef-server and chef-server-webui
are no longer running. They will look like this when running (port 4000
is the chef-server, port 4040 is the chef-server-webui):

    root      1035  0.1  0.0 112216  4276 ?        Sl   Jul07   5:44 merb : merb : master
    root      1784  6.5  0.6 146760 51984 ?        S    Jul07 290:40 merb : worker (port 4040)
    root      7547  0.1  0.4 110788 34104 ?        Sl   Jul09   3:00 merb : merb : master
    root      7554  5.8  0.7 149912 57820 ?        S    Jul09 125:16 merb : worker (port 4000)

Install gecode on the Servers
=============================

Gecode is a pre-requisite of dep\_selector gem, which Chef Server
depends on. It's only needed on the server side.

chef-expander-cluster is no longer there apparently. May I replace it
with chef-expander -n1 to launch it?

Running chef-expander-0.10.0.rc1

Yes, we changed the names to be less confusing and missed a few spots
when we updated the documentation. Now `chef-expander` is the
recommended way to run it, and `chef-expander-vnode` is there for very
advanced use cases.

Additionally, the --pre flag passed to 'gem install chef chef-server' is
also unnecessary now ![image](images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif)

Impatient as I was I wanted to upgrade before the Ubuntu deb's were
released. So I wiped the deb install and did the ruby gem install.

Once the chef-solo bootstrap was complete I started up all the services
and tried things out. Didn't work. Couldn't do the

    knife index rebuild

  
 Additionally rabbitmq started filling up the disk quickly.

The solution was to simply update the rabbitmq password:

    rabbitmqctl change_password chef testing

. After that all seems to be okay.

Before i did my upgrade I put an iptables rule in place to stop
connections. We have recipes that depend on search and they would have
failed while the index was being rebuilt. It also allowed the index to
rebuild faster as it wasn't competing with the clients for cpu time.

Blocks connections (You may need to adjust your interface to match)  
 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 4000 -j DROP

Re-enables connections  
 iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 4000 -j DROP

I also found I needed to restart couchdb and the rabbitmq-server for it
to work. Not sure if that is normal but it was my experience, ymmv

What about a porting guide for the **Cookbooks**? I understand many
coding style changes took place there. not only node:foo is now
node"foo", but also the way I code sending action signals to services
and such. Is this summed up in a Wiki page anywhere? could not find it.
