##### Recipes are the fundamental configuration in Chef. Recipes encapsulate collections of [resources](Resources.html "Resources") which are executed in the order defined to configure the [system](Nodes.html "Nodes")  
  
 Recipes are an internal Ruby domain-specific language (DSL), but you do not need to have experience with Ruby to write recipes.   
  
 Most things in Chef recipes will be resources to configure. Some things in recipes will be Ruby syntax and helper code.

  

Basic Recipe Rules
==================

When writing recipes, keep a few things in mind.

1. Recipes are stored in [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks").  
 2. Resources are executed in the order they appear.  
 3. Recipes are evaluated as Ruby code on the node to find resources to
execute. See [Anatomy of a Chef
Run](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run") for
more information.  
 4. Recipes from other [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks") can be
included with `include_recipe`.  
 5. All the attributes of the current [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") are
available via the `node` object.

### Using Recipes

Recipes are used by assigning them to a node or role run list. They are
assigned using the appropriate name. Recipes are stored in cookbook
directories, and namespaced by the cookbook. The namespacing is used
when assigning recipes to be run by a node. For example for a directory
structure like:

    cookbooks/
    cookbooks/apache2/
    cookbooks/apache2/recipes/
    cookbooks/apache2/recipes/default.rb
    cookbooks/apache2/recipes/mod_ssl.rb

There are two recipes: `apache2` and `apache2::mod_ssl`. On a node,
these are assigned to the node's `run_list`. For example:

    {
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[apache2]",
        "recipe[apache2::mod_ssl]"
      ]
    }

(See [Guide to Creating A Cookbook and Writing A
Recipe](Guide%20to%20Creating%20A%20Cookbook%20and%20Writing%20A%20Recipe.html "Guide to Creating A Cookbook and Writing A Recipe")
for a simple example.)

 Ruby is a language designed to be easy to read and to behave exactly as
you'd expect, so it shouldn't take you too long to get up to speed. See
[Just Enough Ruby for
Chef](Just%20Enough%20Ruby%20for%20Chef.html "Just Enough Ruby for Chef")
for a starting point.

### Dependencies

When using Chef client/server, you must use cookbook
[Metadata](Metadata.html "Metadata") to declare dependencies on
cookbooks' recipes included with `include_recipe`. **This is specified
with the "depends" keyword in the metadata.rb of the cookbook.**

For example, if the above inclusion of `apache2::mod_ssl` was in a
recipe in the "my\_app" cookbook then `cookbooks/my_app/metadata.rb`
would have:

    depends "apache2"

This is not required in Chef Solo because **all** the cookbooks the node
will use must be available since Solo doesn't use a Chef Server to
distribute cookbooks.

**Command-line Cookbook Dependency Solving with Knife Exec**  
  
 Need to replicate a node setup elsewhere, and aren't sure of all the
cookbook dependencies? Or, just want to validate that you've uploaded
all the cookbooks that are stated as being required?

Community member [Stephen Nelson-Smith](http://agilesysadmin.net/) has a
blog post on **[Dependency
Solving](http://agilesysadmin.net/chef-dependencies)** using [Knife
Exec](Knife%20Exec.html "Knife Exec").

Other Data Sources
==================

The Chef Server has core features that are useful in Recipes to build
fully automated dynamic infrastructure.  
  
 \* [Search](Search.html "Search") Indexes  
 \* [Data Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags")  
 \* [Encrypted Data
Bags](Encrypted%20Data%20Bags.html "Encrypted Data Bags")

The Chef Recipe DSL has keywords for using each of these features.

### Search

A basic search query in a recipe looks like this:

    search(:node, "attribute:value")

Searches can be assigned to variables and then used elsewhere in a
recipe. For example, we could search for all nodes with the role
"webserver" assigned, then render a template with them.

    webservers = search(:node, "role:webserver")

    template "/tmp/list_of_webservers" do
      source "list_of_webservers.erb"
      variables(:webservers => webservers)
    end

For more information on [using search in
recipes](Search.html#Search-UsingSearchInRecipes), and search queries in
general, see the [Search](Search.html "Search") documentation. For more
information on the Template resource, see its section on the
[Resources\#Template](Resources.html#Resources-Template) page.

### Data Bags

The Chef Server can have arbitrary stores of JSON data called [Data
Bags](Data%20Bags.html "Data Bags"), which can also be [Encrypted Data
Bags](Encrypted%20Data%20Bags.html "Encrypted Data Bags"). Each bag is a
container of one or more items. These items can be loaded in recipes.
Given the bag "apps", and the following item "my\_app":

    {
      "id": "my_app",
      "repository": "git://github.com/company/my_app.git"
    }

We can access the item in a recipe:

    my_bag = data_bag_item("apps", "my_app")

The item's keys and values can be accessed like a Ruby Hash.

    my_bag["repository"] #=> "git://github.com/company/my_app.git"

Other Recipe DSL Methods
========================

There are other methods available in the Recipe DSL.

### platform?

The `platform?` method will return true if one of the parameters matches
the `node 'platform'`. This method takes a comma separated list of
platforms.

    if platform?("redhat", "centos", "fedora")
      # code for only redhat family systems.
    end

    if platform?("ubuntu")
      # code for only ubuntu systems
    end

### attribute?

The `node.attribute?` method will return true if the specified node
attribute is defined.

    if node.attribute?('ipaddress')
      # the node has an ipaddress
    end

### value\_for\_platform

The `value_for_platform` method uses a hash to select a particular value
based on the `node 'platform'` and `node 'platform_version'`.

**value\_for\_platform syntax**

    value_for_platform(platform => { platform_version => value })

For example, the following will set the `package_name` Ruby variable to
"httpd" on Red Hat family distributions, or "apache2" on Debian family
distributions.

**value\_for\_platform example**

    package_name = value_for_platform(
      ["centos", "redhat", "suse", "fedora" ] => {
        "default" => "httpd"
      },
      ["ubuntu", "debian"] => {
        "default" => "apache2"
      }
    )

Tags
====

To use tags in your recipe simply

    tag('mytag')

If you want to test if a machine is tagged

    tagged?('mytag')

will return true or false. tagged? Takes an array as an argument.

To remove a tag

    untag('mytag')

So all in all

    tag("machine") 

    if tagged?("machine") 
    Chef::Log.info("Hey I'm #{node[:tags]}") 
    end 

    untag("machine") 

    if not tagged?("machine") 
    Chef::Log.info("I has no tagz") 
    end

Will output

    [Thu, 22 Jul 2010 18:01:45 +0000] INFO: Hey I'm machine 
    [Thu, 22 Jul 2010 18:01:45 +0000] INFO: I has no tagz

Ruby in Recipes
===============

Regular Ruby code can also be used in Chef Recipes.

### Variables

Assign values to variables in recipes using the assignment operator, "="

    package_name = "apache2"
    local_dir = node["apache"]["conf_dir"]

### Conditionals

Common conditionals can be used to check for true/false. Note that in
Ruby, only `nil` and `false` are false, **everything** else is true.

#### Case

Select a particular package name for a resource based on the platform.
This is similar to the example above.

    package "apache2" do
      case node[:platform]
      when "centos","redhat","fedora","suse"
        package_name "httpd"
      when "debian","ubuntu"
        package_name "apache2"
      when "arch"
        package_name "apache"
      end 
      action :install
    end

#### If/Unless

If statements check for true or false values.

    if platform?(“debian”, “ubuntu”)
      # do something if node[‘platform’] is debian or ubuntu
    else
      # do other stuff
    end

Unless is the opposite of if.

    unless node[:platform_version] == "5.0"
      # do stuff on everything but 5.0
    end

### Loops

Use the .each method to an Enumerable object (typically an Array or
Hash)

#### Array

Iterate over an array of package names and install them.

    ["apache2", "apache2-mpm"].each do |p|
      package p
    end

#### Hash

Iterate over a hash of gem package names with specific versions.

    {"fog" => "0.6.0", "highline" => "1.6.0"}.each do |g,v|
      gem_package g do
        version v
      end
    end

Exceptions and Logging
======================

To write to the chef log, optionally causing an exception use
Chef::Log  
 You can write with a level of debug, info, warn, error, fatal

For example:

-   Info only, no exception

        Chef::Log.info('Some useful information')

-   Fatal, raising exception

        Chef::Log.fatal('Something bad happened and I want to stop')

It would be nice to add something about how to handle errors and
logging. Like whats the appropriate way to generate an error exception
or exit if the recipe test decides that something is bad and should
immediately exit the chef-client run.

Another case that I always forget how to do in Chef is to stop
processing a recipe but not be an error. Just short-circuit that recipe
to return/exit and allow the chef-client run to continue.

And it might be good to put in this recipes page how to do logging with
Chef::Log as well as any other normal non-resource but Chef specific
things like logging and exception generation...
