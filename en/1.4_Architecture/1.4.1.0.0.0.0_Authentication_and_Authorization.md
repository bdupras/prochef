Overview
========

#### Chef-client and knife both communicate with the Chef Server using a [REST API](Server%20API.html "Server API").

##### [Chef-clients](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") make API requests to retrieve their run list, download their cookbooks, and save their state after a successful run.

##### When developing cookbooks and managing your infrastructure, you will regularly use [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") commands which make API request to the [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server").

  
  

### Before being processed by the server, each request goes through two processes

##### Authentication: Verifies the identity of the API client communicating with the Chef Server.

##### Authorization: Verifies that the identified client has the permission to perform the requested actions.

After your initial configuration of nodes and your workstations, these
processes are largely transparent. However, understanding both of these
processes is often important when debugging potential problems.

Since **[Chef-Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo")** does not communicate
with a Chef Server, authentication and authorization do not play a role
in the normal use of chef-solo. This article covers how a given API
client's requests are authenticated and authorized. For information
about specific errors see [Common
Errors](Common%20Errors.html "Common Errors").

Authentication
==============

**Authentication ensures that requests received by the Chef Server are
from known API clients**

The authentication process in Chef uses public key encryption, and is
the same for users of the Open Source Chef Server as well as Hosted Chef
and Private Chef.

When an API client is created, private and public encryption keys are
created. The public key is stored on the Chef Server, while the private
key is returned to the user for safe keeping. The private key is the
".pem" file that you put in your local `.chef` directory or in
`/etc/chef`. Chef executables such as `chef-client` and `knife`
authenticate requests to the Chef Server by encrypting a specially
crafted set of HTTP Headers with the private key. The Chef Server then
uses the public key to de-crypt the headers and verifies their content.

This process helps ensure that requests are only accepted from known API
clients.

For technical details on how API requests are authentication see [Making
Authenticated API
Requests](Making%20Authenticated%20API%20Requests.html "Making Authenticated API Requests").
To debug common problems that can result in Authorization errors, see
[Common Errors](Common%20Errors.html "Common Errors").

Initial Chef-client run
-----------------------

![image](../attachments/19071693/20086875.png)  
Since every request from chef-client to the Chef Server must be
authenticated, every node must have an API client. To avoid requiring
administrators to create new API clients for each node they would like
to add to their infrastructure, Chef uses a special **validator client**
on the first run of chef-client.

The validator client's key pair is created when you first install an
Chef Server or create a Hosted Chef organization and is moved onto
clients by the [Knife
Bootstrap](Knife%20Bootstrap.html "Knife Bootstrap") process or manually
during the chef-client install process. *This validator client creates a
new API client that the node can then use for all future request.*

A check is done to see if a client key exists on the node (typically,
`/etc/chef/client.pem`)

-   If so, we use it to start signing requests.

-   If not, we check if a validation key exists on the node (typically,
    `/etc/chef/validation.pem`).
    -   If so, we request a new API Client Key, signing our request with
        the validation key.
    -   If not, we fail.

If we were issued a new API Client Key, we start using it to sign
subsequent requests.

Debugging Authentication Problems
---------------------------------

Authentication problems are situations in which chef-client receives
HTTP Status 401 in response to its request. If you are receiving HTTP
Status 403, the problem is with **Authorization**.

An authentication error error may look like the following:

    [Wed, 05 Oct 2011 15:43:34 -0700] INFO: HTTP Request Returned 401 Unauthorized: Failed to authenticate as NODENAME. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct.

To debug authentication problems, the first piece of information to
determine is the API client that chef-client is attempting to
authenticate as. You can usually see this in the log messages emitted by
chef-client. For instance if you turn on debug logging
(`chef-client -l debug`) you will see a line such as:

    [Wed, 05 Oct 2011 22:05:35 +0000] DEBUG: Signing the request as SOMENODENAMEHERE

**If the authentication is happening with your validator client, the
problem is most likely with your validation key.**

**If the authentication is happening with the nodes API client, there
are a number of common causes.**

-   Your client.pem file is incorrect.  
     This can be fixed by deleting client.pem and re-running
    chef-client. When chef-client runs, it will register the API client
    and generate the correct key.

-   You are trying to authenticate with a node\_name that is different
    from the one you used on your first chef-client run.  
     This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, if your
    client.rb file does not specify your node name and you have recently
    changed the systems hostname. You can fix this by explicitly setting
    the node name in the client.rb file or with chef-client's -N option
    to match the name originally used to register. Alternatively, you
    can re-register using the method described above.

-   Your system clock has drifted from the actual time by more than 15
    minutes. This can be fixed by syncing your clock with an NTP server.

WebUI
-----

The WebUI also uses Chef Server's REST API to perform most operations.
As such requests from the API are also authenticated. The WebUI
authenticates using a keypair that is generated during the installation.
Hosted Chef users need not worry about the management of the WebUIs
authentication keys, as Opscode handles that for you. Private Chef users
WebUI authentication keys are managed by the internal administrator(s)
responsible for the Private Chef server.

Authorization
=============

**Authorization ensures the API client making a given request has the
permission to perform the requested action**

Open Source Chef has a single tenant access control model, which is very
different from the role-based access control (RBAC) model of Hosted Chef
and Private Chef.

*See **[Hosted Chef
Authorization](Hosted%20Chef%20Authorization.html "Hosted Chef Authorization")**
for the Hosted Chef and Private Chef authorization model.*

Authorization in the Open Source Chef Server is governed by the
designation of API clients as non-admin, admin, or validator clients.   
 Certain functions are available to all clients, others are available to
either admin clients or the validator clients, and some are only
available to admin clients. Further, API clients are permitted to
perform certain actions on themselves or their related node but not on
other clients.

Admin clients are created by setting the client's `admin` attribute to
true.   
 This attribute can be set upon client create when using
`knife client create` or by using `knife client edit`.

Validator clients are created during the Chef Server installation.

Summary
=======

**Open Source Chef Server has a single tenant access control model.**

1.  All stored objects (roles, nodes, cookbooks, data bags, search
    indexes) are in the same virtual space and accessible to all API
    clients.
2.  All API clients are authorized as either "admin" or "normal."
    -   "Admin" API clients perform privileged tasks such as
        create/read/update/delete operations on all nodes.
    -   "Normal" API clients act upon the node they create.

**The role-based access control (RBAC) model of Hosted and Private Chef
is detailed at **[Hosted Chef
Authorization](Hosted%20Chef%20Authorization.html "Hosted Chef Authorization")**.**
