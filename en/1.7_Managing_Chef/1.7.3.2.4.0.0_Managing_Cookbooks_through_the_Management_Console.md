Viewing the Contents of a Specific Cookbook
-------------------------------------------

To view the contents of a specific cookbook:

1. Log on to the Management Console.

2. Click `Cookbooks` on the main navigation menu.

3. Click the link of the cookbook you want to view.

Note: This may take longer for very large cookbooks.

Click on Library Files, Attribute Files, Definition Files, Recipe Files,
or Template Files to view the contents of the cookbook. If you do not
see one of these links, the cookbook does not have files of that type.
