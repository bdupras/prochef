Chef Client
===========

### The Chef Client is where almost all of the work in Chef is done.   
  
 It communicates with the [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") via REST, authenticates via [Signed Header Authentication](Authentication%20and%20Authorization.html "Authentication and Authorization"), and compiles and executes [Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks").

### Clients do work for one or many Nodes

A Chef Client does work on behalf of a [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes"). A
single Chef Client can run recipes for multiple
[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes").

### Clients do all the work

Clients are where all the action happens - the [Chef
Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") and [Chef
Indexer](Chef%20Indexer.html "Chef Indexer") are largely services that
exist only to provide the Client with information.

You can run the client periodically
-----------------------------------

If you want, you can run the Chef Client as a persistent daemon. To do
this, make your startup script for the chef client execute something
like:

**Chef Client Interval and Splay**

    $ chef-client -i 3600 -s 600

The `-i` option provides an *Interval* - it's how often the Chef client
will attempt to wake up and Converge this [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes").
The `-s` option is the *Splay* - a random piece of time added to the
interval, which helps avoid the [thundering herd
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).

You can trigger a run on the daemonized client
----------------------------------------------

You can wake up the chef-client daemon and cause it to start a run by
sending the process a SIGUSR1. On Linux you can do something like:

**Trigger Chef Client to Start a Run on Linux**

    $ sudo killall -USR1 chef-client

If \`killall\` doesn't work that way on your OS, you will want to find
the process and send the signal directly:

    $ ps auxw|grep chef-client
    root           66066   0.9  0.0  2488880    264 s001  S+   10:26AM   0:03.05 /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/chef-client -i 3600 -s 20
    $ sudo kill -USR1 66066

**[Anatomy of a Chef
Run](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run")**  
  
[Anatomy of a Chef
Run](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run")
describes the process taken by the [Chef Client]( "Chef Client") to
configure an individual [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") in detail.

***Chef-Client Cookbook***   
  
 The [Opscode chef-client
cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef-client) is
available for use on systems that should have a \`chef-client\` daemon
running, such as when Knife bootstrap was used to install Chef on a new
system.

It includes the interval set at 1800 seconds and the splay set at 20
seconds, as configurable defaults, and additional configurable detail
information as detailed on this page.
