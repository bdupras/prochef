##### Chef Cookbooks require you to specify a small amount of meta-data. This information is used to provide hints to the Chef Server as to what cookbooks should be deployed to a given node, and in the future it will be integral to an automated system for discovering and installing cookbooks.

  
**To get started, you need to create a `metadata.rb` file at the top of
your cookbook.** This file provides a simple ruby DSL for building the
actual metadata file (which is stored as JSON). If you create a new
cookbook by using `knife cookbook create` command, a template
metadata.rb file will be created for you.

metadata.rb
===========

**We never interpret the metadata file directly, we only ever use the
compiled JSON file!** Currently, the metadata JSON is generated for you
when you upload the cookbook or run the
`knife cookbook metadata COOKBOOK` command. It's a good practice to
always edit metadata.rb but not the JSON file, but if you need to edit
metadata.json directly, remember that it will be overwritten by
metadata.rb next time when you generate metadata or upload cookbook
using `knife`, if metadata.rb exists.

At the moment, we utilize the following fields in the metadata:

-   maintainer
-   maintainer\_email
-   license
-   description
-   long\_description
-   depends
-   version
-   recipe

Meaningful Fields
=================

The following fields are used by the Chef Server, WebUI, or Opscode
Community Site.

name
----

The name of the cookbook. Normally this is inferred, but you can
override it in the cookbook metadata.

**name example**

    name 'cats'

**Did you get sent here by an error message?**  
  
 If so, here is the deal. The Chef Server tries to only distribute the
cookbooks that are needed to configure each individual
[Node](Nodes.html "Nodes"). In order to do that, we take the list of
[Roles](Roles.html "Roles") and [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") that
are assigned directly to that system, expand the list of dependencies
for them, and then ship that set to the [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes").

If you forget to specify a dependency in a cookbooks metadata, then the
Chef Server will not realize that the cookbook is necessary to complete
your configuration... resulting in the error message that brought you
here. To fix it, simply add the right 'depends' entry to your
metadata.rb file and try again.

Looks great so far!!!

Any intention of adding a service to the depends field? For example, I
may want my MySQL cookbook to require a 'disk' provider like LVM?

Good work![image](images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif)

Yeah - we should update the documentation to reflect it, but I imagine
you would do something like:

**depends on a resource**

    depends "execute[has_lvm]"

Similarly, for a definition (ie: you want to just call something to
setup your disks:

**depends on a definition**

    depends "disk(:type, :volumes, :mount_point)"

The above would verify that a definition exists with those params being
valid.

Just thinking about how my UI would digest this information and create a
display...

Here's my use case:  
 I don't want to show every possible attribute in the recipe - that
would be overwhelming to the user. Ideally, I would only show the
absolute minimum attributes required for a cookbook to run. However, the
user may still like to drill down into some 'optional' and/or 'advanced'
attributes. (maybe there are other classifications? like 'recommended'?
e.g. apache[:contact])

The definition for a metadata attribute field, from above, is "Adds an
attribute that a user needs to configure for this cookbook". Can this
also be used for specify optional attributes? I'm a bit confused
regarding the purpose of the "required" field if all attributes "need"
to be set. I am also confused why a "default" value would be specified
if it is required to be set by the user.

We should definitely allow you to specify optional attributes. In my
mind, that was the purpose of the 'required' field, but that only gives
you two levels of control: either you must specify it, or you may not.
No extra information like "optional", "advanced" or "recommended".

I'm updating the wiki to reflect that not all the attributes are
required. Cary, it would be great if you could post an example of how
you would like to see the attribute meta-data extended to fit your
requirements.

The "required" property specifies whether an attribute must have a
value. If a default value is provided, then in effect a value is always
provided. The purpose of this property is to avoid launching servers in
a situation that is guaranteed to fail because attributes are missing.
So an attribute which is not required but for which there's a default
value is a bit odd, except that you could go in and specifically erase
the default value and it'd be ok. This raises the question of whether a
distinction is made between "empty=nil" and "not specified". It also
raises the question about where defaults are filled in. Is this
something that is supposed to be done on the server end, is it done when
chef client starts, or is it supposed to be done in the cookbook code
itself? It would be good to avoid creating inconsistencies between the
metadata and the cookbook code...

The other aspect that is not captured is that we see a real tension with
respect to the number of attributes. It's really good for first time
users to be able to "just plop down apache" having to focus only on a
couple of required attributes they need to set. But there's also the
advanced users that come along with a "if only you had this optional
attribute then I would have to fork the cookbook to get this little
change in". I'm wondering whether we should change the "Required" field
from boolean to "required"/"optional"/"ancillary" (or "adanced"). We
could have a separate "display\_priority" property but required
attributes should be top priority, so these are not really orthogonal.

After initial release of our UI it has become clear that some changes
would make our life easier. Summary of proposed changes:

1.  Clarify the meaning of "type" option to simply: "the type of value
    passed to the recipe".
2.  "hash" type seems not a value at all, but a "section" or "grouping"
    of values. To avoid the confusion, let's make a new metadata field
    altogether (below a "grouping" field is suggested).
3.  replace the 'multiple\_values' option, with the 'choice' option
    (choices are always of type "string")
4.  If type is string, allow user one choice. If type is array, allow
    user many choices. "choice" is an array of strings.
5.  Change "required" option from boolean to preset levels
6.  Add a boolean "calculated" option for those times when a default is
    impossible to predict because it is calculated somewhere in the
    recipe. However, exposing this attribute allows the user to override
    the calculation.

Below is the modified wiki sections that contain these proposals....

* * * * *

<snip\>

attribute
---------

Adds an attribute that a user may need to configure for this cookbook.
Takes a name (with the / notation for a nested attribute), followed by
any of these options:

Option

Possible Values

Descriptions

display\_name

String

What a UI should show for this attribute

description

String

A hint as to what this attr is for

choice

Array of strings

Array of choices to present to the user. If type is string, allow user
one choice. If type is array, allow user many choices.   

calculated   

true or false   

If true, the default value is calculated by the recipe and cannot be
displayed. If value != nil, calculated default will be overwritten.   

type

"string", "array"

The type of value passed to the recipe - default is "string".   

required

"required", "recommended", "optional"   

The level of user input this attribute requires - default is "optional"
  
 "required" : User must provide input. The "default" option must not be
set.   
 "recommended" : A default value is set, but the user probably should
change it. (i.e. apache[:contact] = "ops@example.com")   
 "optional": Default values are set and there is no need to change
unless the user knows what they are doing.   
 For backwards compatibility,   
 "required: true" is interpreted as "required: required" and   
 "required: false" is interpreted as "required: optional"

recipes

Array

An array of recipes which need this attr set. If not set, the attribute
is global to recipes in "this" cookbook

default

String , Array

The default value for this attribute. This value(s) must exist in any
non-empty 'choice' array. Do not define if 'calculated' is true.   

**attribute description**

    attribute 'pets/cat/name',
    :display_name => "Cat Name",
    :description => "The name of your cat",
    :choice => \[ 'kitty kitty', 'peanut', 'einstein', 'honey' \],
    :type => "string",
    :required => "recommended",
    :recipes => \[ 'cats::eat' \],
    :default => "kitty kitty"

grouping
--------

Adds a displayable title and description to a group of attributes within
a namespace. Takes a name (with the / notation for a nested grouping),
followed by any of these options:

Option

Possible Values

Descriptions

title

String

Title for this group of attributes

description

String

A hint as to what these attributes are for

**attribute grouping description**

    grouping 'pets/cat',
    :title => "Cat Options",
    :description => "Describe your cat using the options below"

</snip\>

Adopted in v0.8.x -- Updated page with the above info. 6/4/2010

For backwards compatibility, "required: true" is interpreted as
"required: required".

Some kind of i18n at this level would make sense

:display\_name =\>"Cat Name",

:display\_name \_de =\>"Name der Katze",

or

:display\_name =\> {"Cat Name", :translations =\> { :de =\> "Name der
Katze"}}

yml files could be calculated to something like

pets\_cat\_display\_name =

I'm finding the attribute definitions and groupings to be extremely
useful. I've written a utility script to aid in composing role and node
attributes based on the defined metadata attributes and groupings. It's
coming along great. It parses the metadata.json groupings and attributes
into command line user input widgets, e.g. yes/no, true/false, multiple
choice, text string, etc. A few things that I think would be really
useful would be a way to order groupings and attributes and to be able
to define dependencies on other attributes. My current use case is
mysql. For example, if auto-tune is true, there is no need to ask about
buffer tuning sizes. another example is if innodb support is false, then
don't bother asking about innnodb buffer pool settings and such.

I'm imagining ordering and dependencies could be defined as such...

**metadata.rb example**

    [snip]
    grouping 'instance/tuning',
    :title => 'mysqld instance tuning paramters',
    :description => 'Tuning parameters for mysql server',
    # this grouping is #1 in order.  Other groupings should have a higher order number.
    :order => 1

    attribute 'mysql/instance/tuning/auto',
    :display_name => 'auto tune instance',
    :description => 'instance can be auto tuned according to node memory size',
    :type => 'string',
    :required => 'optional',
    :choice => [ 'true', 'false' ],
    :recipes => [ 'mysql::default' ],
    :default => 'true',
    # this means this attribute is first in this grouping
    :order => 1

    attribute 'mysql/instance/tuning/innodb_buffer_pool_size',
    :display_name => 'innodb buffer pool size',
    :description => 'innodb_buffer_pool_size (include K, M, G).',
    :type => 'string',
    :required => 'optional',
    :choice => [ '256M', '512M', '1G', '2G' ],
    :recipes => [ 'mysql::default' ],
    :default => '512M',
    # this attribute is ordered so it comes second in this grouping
    :order => 2,
    # this means that this attribute depends on the value of two previous attributes 
    :depends => { 'mysql/instance/tuning/auto' => 'false', 'mysql/instance/innodb' => 'true' }
    [snip]

Of course it'd be up to the programmer to properly display things in
order since json is not ordered. I'm sure someone smarter than me could
also come with a better/more flexible way to define dependencies and
behavior based on dependencies, but you catch my drift.
![image](images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif)

UPDATE...

I noticed that I can stick whatever I want in the definitions and it
just works (meaning it appears in the metadata.json). I'm reworking my
code to obey the "order" and "depends" to see how it all works out.

Will this behavior remain? I mean will I always be able to arbitrarily
add my own variables into the grouping and attribute definitions and
have them appear in the metadata.json without breaking things?

Can the maintainer and maintainer\_email contain more than one person?
What is the recommended way to convey the fact that I forked the
cookbook but I want to have the original person in there as well as
myself.

Hello Robert,

You can only have one person as the maintainer and maintainer\_email.
You could however list the maintainer as something like "Runa
Administrators" and then put a mailing list as the maintainer\_email
that is forwarded to multiple people.

There is a bit of information on this in our [How to Contribute Wiki
Article](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute) as
well:

"How should I update the header file of my contribution to properly
credit earlier contributors and recognize copyrights?

You need to put attribution about the origins of some of the code in the
NOTICE file for your app. On an individual header, you can add yourself
as an author/copyright holder, placing text in the header file saying
that your new work is based on previous work, and referencing the
original header below.

If the original file is lacking the license header, please let us know,
so we can add one. Even in their absence, they are covered by the Apache
2 license."

You could also place this information in the description, or the
readme.md if you'd like it noted in any additional places. Feel free to
update this ticket if you have any further questions for us about this.

Thanks,  
 Jessica

Is there are way to specify a dependency on a Chef version range?  
 i.e. : chef\_depends: [ "\>= 0.10.10", "< 1.0.0" ]

This would be useful when there are dependencies that aren't available
before/after certain chef versions (like chef\_gem).  
 We could then have chef-solo and chef-client display an explicit
message: "This feature is only available on Chef versions \>= 0.10.10
and < 1.0.0".
