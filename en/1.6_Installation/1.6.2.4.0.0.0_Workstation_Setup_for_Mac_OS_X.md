#### This article explains how to setup a Chef Workstation on OS X.

##### A Chef workstation is where you develop cookbooks, interact with your chef-server, and interact with nodes.

  
**Such a workstation typically includes:**

-   A local repository of your cookbooks and possibly other data.
-   A well-configured knife client

**To create such a workstation, this article explains how to:**

1.  Install Ruby and other Chef dependencies
2.  Install Chef
3.  Install Git
4.  Create a bare-bones chef repository
5.  Configure Knife

This has been tested and verified on the following versions of Mac OS X:

-   Mac OS X 10.6.7 (Snow Leopard)

For those of you running OS X Server Lion 10.7.3, you can download Xcode
4 directly from the app store for free. However to follow the
instructions you will need to install the command line tools compile
gems. This is found under Xcode preferences \>\> downloads \>\> command
line tools.

Should this doc get switched to reference
[http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/?](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/?)
Getting a solid ruby built from source on OS X is kind of pain at the
moment. The omnibus installer would probably be a good starting point
for people who want to use Chef but aren't interested in ruby
development.

We actually just published the Omnibus directions in the wiki today.
We're keeping these operating specific directions for people who don't
want to use the Omnibus installer or an embedded version of Ruby.

You can find information on the Omnibus installer on these pages:
