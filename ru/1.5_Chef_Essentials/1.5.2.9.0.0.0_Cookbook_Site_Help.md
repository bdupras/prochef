#### The [Opscode Cookbook Site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com) is a community site where you can share, contribute to, and/or download cookbooks through the web site or its [REST API](Cookbook%20Site%20API.html "Cookbook Site API").

  

You must first have the capability to interact with the site, following
which you'll be able to access, download, use and contribute to the
community cookbooks.

Interaction with the Community Site
===================================

Opscode has Single Sign-On for the Community Site and for Hosted Chef -
so if you have an account for one, then you have an account for both.
You'll need to be logged in if you already have an account. If you don't
have an account - sign up, it's free!

Resetting the Password to the Community Site
--------------------------------------------

There are two ways to reset the password, depending on if you are able
to log in with your current password or not.

### Changing your password with your current password

1.  On the homepage of the Opscode [cookbooks
    site](http://cookbooks.opscode.com), click your username in the
    upper right corner next to *Logged in as*.
2.  On the page showing your user details, click the change my password
    link, as shown below:

3.  Enter your current password, new password, and confirm your new
    password, and then click the "Change Password" button.  
    *Note that password needs to be 6 to 50 characters long.*

### Changing your password without your current password

If you forget your current password, you can change your password
without using the current password.

*You will need to know your Opscode user name's email address so that
you can get an email to reset your password.*

1.  On the homepage of the Opscode cookbooks site
    ([http://cookbooks.opscode.com](http://cookbooks.opscode.com)),
    click the *Recover Password* link in the upper right corner.
2.  On the Recover Your Password page, enter the Email Address that you
    used to register with Opscode, and click the *Submit* button.  
     You will receive an email with a link to reset your password.
