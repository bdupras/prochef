Yum Package Resource
====================

Manage packages.

  

##### In addition to supporting the typical package resource options for installation, upgrade and removal the Yum Package Resource has several additional attributes and hidden options that Enterprise Linux users may find useful.

This document is only valid for Chef \>= 0.10.4

The most notable difference with the yum package provider is being able
to resolve [Provides data](http://rpm5.org/docs/api/dependencies.html)
for packages much like yum on the command line. This enables a variety
of interesting options for installing packages by minimum versions,
virtual provides and library names. The only portion the provider
doesn't support at the moment is installing via file names, eg:
yum\_package "/bin/sh", like yum can. The volume of data to parse for
this is excessive.

Some attributes are unique to the Yum provider and require the use of
the 'yum\_package' resource instead of the 'package' resource.

Examples
--------

These are in addition to the standard [Resources -
Package](Resources.html#Resources-Package) examples.

**Install package**

    yum_package "netpbm" do
      action :install
    end

    # or with the default action
    yum_package "netpbm"

    # or via Provides data (at least 2x slower for intial install/upgrade to gather
    # remote Provides data)
    yum_package "libnetpbm.so.10"

**Install a specific version**

    yum_package "netpbm" do
      # must be a complete version-release
      version "10.35.58-8.el5"
    end

    # or via Provides data with an exact version
    yum_package "netpbm = 10.35.58-8.el5"

    # or via Provides data with a minimum version
    yum_package "netpbm >= 10.35.58-8.el5"

    # or via Provides data with a partial minimum version
    yum_package "netpbm >= 10"

**Install a specific version, even if older than the installed one**

    # To see what packages are available for this, add showdupesfromrepos=1 to /etc/yum.conf
    yum_package "tzdata" do
      version "2011b-1.el5"
      allow_downgrade true
    end

**Install a specific arch**

    yum_package "netpbm" do
      arch "i386"
    end

    # or via package name
    yum_package "netpbm.x86_64"

**Install new Yum repositories from package**

    # This package contains /etc/yum.repos.d/ repository configs. Some of these repos have
    # newer packages and possibly a higher priority than what's in the cache, so we dump it.
    yum_package "foo-release" do
      action :install
      flush_cache [ :after ]
    end

    # This package will now be picked up immediately instead of first looking at Provides
    # data for a match which is slower. Also you are sure to get the correct version based
    # on the repository configs.
    yum_package "only-in-new-repo" do
      action :install
    end

**Install new Yum repositories from file**

    cookbook_file "/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo" do
      source "custom"
      mode "0644"
    end

    # Ensure the cache is dumped and the new repository is used immediately to ensure we
    # find the correct package to install.
    yum_package "only-in-custom-repo" do
      action :install
      flush_cache [ :before ]
    end

    # Unfortunately this is only useful if cookbook_file and yum_package are called within
    # the same recipe with the correct order - a pretty narrow use case.

**Install new Yum repositories from file - improved**

    # Thanks to gaffneyc @ https://gist.github.com/918711 this is much nicer general 
    # solution that doesn't rely on the provider at all: we have the install of the
    # repository trigger a creation of the yum cache and force the internal Chef cache
    # to reload as well.
    execute "create-yum-cache" do
      command "yum -q makecache"
      action :nothing
    end

    ruby_block "reload-internal-yum-cache" do
      block do
        Chef::Provider::Package::Yum::YumCache.instance.reload
      end
      action :nothing
    end

    cookbook_file "/etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo" do
      source "custom"
      mode "0644"
      notifies :run, resources(:execute => "create-yum-cache"), :immediately
      notifies :create, resources(:ruby_block => "reload-internal-yum-cache"), :immediately
    end

    # Deleting a repo is similar but we have yum scrub it's cache to avoid any issues
    execute "clean-yum-cache" do
      command "yum clean all"
      action :nothing
    end

    file "/etc/yum.repos.d/bad.repo" do
      action :delete
      notifies :run, resources(:execute => "clean-yum-cache"), :immediately
      notifies :create, resources(:ruby_block => "reload-internal-yum-cache"), :immediately
    end
