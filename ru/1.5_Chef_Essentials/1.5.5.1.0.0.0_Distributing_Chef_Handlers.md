Distributing Chef Handlers
==========================

  

![image](../attachments/12354152/20840636.png)   
  

Opscode provides a [cookbook](http://cookbooks.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef_handler) for distributing custom Chef Handlers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Add cookbook to chef-repo

Download the cookbook to your [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository").

    % knife cookbook site install chef_handler
    Installing chef_handler to /Users/schisamo/dev/chef_repositories/development/.chef/../cookbooks
    Checking out the master branch.

### Write Chef Handler

See the [Exception and Report
Handlers](Exception%20and%20Report%20Handlers.html "Exception and Report Handlers")
page for instructions on how to write new Chef handlers. These files
will go under `cookbooks/chef_handler/files/default/handlers`.

    $EDITOR cookbooks/chef_handler/files/default/handlers/cloudkick_handler.rb

### Change the Handler Path

If you wish to change the directory where the handlers are copied, edit
the cookbook attributes file and change the path for the
`node['chef_handler']['handler_path']` attribute. You can also set this
value in a role.

    default['chef_handler']['handler_path'] = "/var/chef/handlers"

### Enable the Chef Handler with the `chef_handler` LWRP

After you distribute handler files down to the node, you have to enable
it so Chef will know to fire it on the conclusion of Chef runs. This is
very easy to do using the `chef_handler` LWRP. This LWRP requires,
configures and enables handlers on the node for the current Chef run. It
also has the ability to pass arguments to the handlers initializer,
allowing initialization data to be pulled from a node's attribute data.

    chef_handler "CloudkickHandler" do
      source "#{node['chef_handler']['handler_path']}/cloudkick_handler.rb"
      arguments [node['cloudkick']['oauth_key'], node['cloudkick']['oauth_secret']]
      action :enable
    end

**It is best to declare \`chef\_handler\` resources early on in the
compile phase so they are available to fire for any exceptions during
the Chef run.**   
*If you have a base role you would want any recipes that register Chef
handlers to come first in the run\_list.*

### Upload to your Chef Server

The cookbook needs to be uploaded to the Chef Server to be used.

    knife cookbook upload chef_handler
    Uploading chef_handler             [1.0.0]
    upload complete

### Add the recipe to a run list

Add the `recipe[chef_handler]` to a node or role run list. Put it first
to make sure your custom handlers are loaded and available to other
recipes.   
 When Chef
[runs](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run"),
during the compile phase the handlers will be copied into place and be
available for enabling with the `chef_handler` LWRP.

### Additional Information

See the
[README.md](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef_handler/blob/master/README.md)
of the `chef_handler` cookbook for additional information.
