Using Search in the Hosted Chef Management Console
==================================================

  

### This page explains how to use search:

-   Listing Search Indexes
-   Searching the Indexes

-   **To follow these directions, first [log into the Hosted Chef
    Management
    Console](Managing%20your%20Account%20and%20Billing%20Information.html#ManagingyourAccountandBillingInformation-LogintotheManagementConsole)
    with your existing username.** If you have not signed up for an
    account yet, follow the directions on the [Setup Opscode User and
    Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")
    page.

-   **If you're interested in editing account, nodes or other data in
    the Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
    Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
    and make the appropriate selection.**

Listing Search Indexes
----------------------

More information on searching can be found on the
[Search](Search.html "Search") page. You can also use the command line
tool [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") to search.

In order to see the list of Search Indexes:

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click on the *Search* tab on the main navigation menu.

This page will list all of the Indexes you can search within such as
Environments, Clients, Roles, Nodes, or Data Bags.

Searching the Indexes
---------------------

You can search through the Search Indexes including Environments,
Clients, Roles, Nodes, or Data Bags by using the "attribute:value"
syntax on the search page in the Management Console. More information
about this syntax can be found in the [Search](Search.html "Search")
article.

For example, if you want to search a client whose name is "foobar":

1. Log on to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click on the *Search* tab on the main navigation menu.

3. In the text box under the "Client" search index, enter
"clientname:foobar" and click on the *Search client* button.

The results will look like this if there is a client named "foobar":

If you leave the search box empty, it returns all the objects of that
type. Searching for Environments, Data Bags, Nodes, and Roles work the
same way.
