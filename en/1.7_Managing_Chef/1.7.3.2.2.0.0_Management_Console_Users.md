Management Console Users
========================

### In Chef 0.8.2 and above, Management Console users are maintained separately from [API Client](API%20Clients.html "API Clients") and [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") credentials.  
  
 You can associate an OpenID to your user and use that to authenticate, or authenticate using your user credentials in Chef's CouchDB database.

Logging in For the First Time
-----------------------------

The Management Console runs on port 4040 by default. Navigate your
browser to
[http://chef.example.com:4040/](http://chef.example.com:4040/)
(replacing chef.example.com with the actual hostname of your Chef
server, of course). You'll be redirected to the login screen.

**When logging in for the first time, use the default credentials**

**Username:**

admin

**Password:**

p@ssw0rd1

  

###### When you log in as the default admin user, you're immediately redirected to the edit page for that user.

###### After changing the default password, you can add add new users or use any other features of the Management Console.

**Change the Default Password**  
  
 Default passwords are no better than not having a password. They're
evil. They must die. Please change the default password and never use it
again.

**Using the Bootstrap Recipe**  
When using the
[bootstrap::server](Installing%20Chef%20Server%20using%20Chef%20Solo.html "Installing Chef Server using Chef Solo")
recipe, this is actually a randomly generated password, and set in
`/etc/chef/server.rb` through the template, with the setting
`web_ui_admin_default_password`. This can be set to a different value by
setting `webui_admin_password` in the chef.json.
