===============================

#### This page describes how to manually set up a [Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server"). This is the only option if your platform does not have native Chef packages and your platform is not supported by the RubyGem installation bootstrap.

##### These procedures will assume installation of Chef is done with RubyGems, and commands are executed as root through `sudo`. If your system does not have sudo installed, we recommend it. Otherwise, login as root and run the command w/o `sudo`.

Install Ruby and Chef
=====================

Chef-server is written in Ruby. Per Operating System directions for
installing Ruby and Chef can be found at [Installing Chef Client and
Chef
Solo](Installing%20Chef%20Client%20and%20Chef%20Solo.html "Installing Chef Client and Chef Solo").

Install CouchDB
===============

Chef requires CouchDB version 0.9.1 or higher. If CouchDB 0.9.1+ is not
available as a package on your platform, you'll need to install it from
source. You may also need to install Erlang from source. *See the
[CouchDB installation
instructions](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation) for more
information.*

Once CouchDB is installed, you'll need to start it. If you installed it
from a package for your platform, this might be done automatically. If
you installed from source, check the source tarball for init scripts or
instructions for your platform. You shouldn't need any other special
configurationâ€”Chef Server will create its database when it starts for
the first time.

Install RabbitMQ
================

The [Chef Indexer](Chef%20Indexer.html "Chef Indexer") sends messages
across an AMQP queue to get them indexed for search. We use RabbitMQ for
this. You'll need to download and install RabbitMQ as appropriate for
your platform, see [their site](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

Once RabbitMQ is installed, make sure the service is running.

### Configure RabbitMQ

Once RabbitMQ is installed, you'll need to set up the queue. The
following commands assume v1.6+ syntax.

    sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /chef
    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user chef testing
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /chef chef ".*" ".*" ".*"
