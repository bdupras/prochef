Know Your Rights: Windows File Security In Chef
===============================================

With 0.10.10, we’re overhauling the Windows security settings for file
and directory resources to work the way Windows works. Specifically,
we’re adding inheritance and full ACL support, and tweaking the owner,
group and mode attributes to do the right thing on Windows. We’ve made
these changes directly to the template, file, remote\_file,
cookbook\_file, directory, and remote\_directory resources, so you can
start getting the benefit right away by modifying your existing recipes.

Unix security configuration will not change.
