Providers
=========

  

  

### Providers take a [resource](Resources.html "Resources"), compare that [resource](Resources.html "Resources") to the current state of the part of the system it is managing, and then takes the Action specified in the [resource](Resources.html "Resources").

##### Providers allow Chef to support multiple platforms with a single Resource.

What providers are available?
-----------------------------

The real question you should be asking is *"What providers are available
for a given [Resource](Resources.html "Resources")?"* You can find that
answer by looking at the [Resources](Resources.html "Resources") page,
in the Providers section for any individual resource type.

How does Chef know which Provider to use?
-----------------------------------------

Chef maps Providers to Platforms (and Platform Versions) via
`Chef::Platform`. In this class you will find a class instance variable
`@platforms`, which consists of a Hash of various Platforms and
Versions. We look up the resource type in this hash according to your
[Nodes](Nodes.html "Nodes") platform and platform\_version
[Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") (which are provided by
[Ohai](Ohai.html "Ohai")).

How do Providers... Provide?
----------------------------

We did our best to keep adding new Providers to Chef as simple as
possible.

For each resource:

1.  We look up the proper provider
2.  We build a new instance of that provider
3.  We call `load_current_resource`, which uses the `@new_resource` as a
    "guide" to look up the current state of the resource under
    management.
4.  We then call the `action_` method for the action provided.
5.  Ensure we mark the resource as `updated` if any changes happened.

For example, given a resource such as:

**"Sample Resource"**

    directory "/tmp/monkey" do
      owner "root"
      group "root"
      mode 0755
      action :create
    end

We would:

1.  Look up the provider for a
    [directory](Resources.html#Resources-Directory) resource, which
    happens to be Chef::Provider::Directory
2.  Call `load_current_resource`, which creates a new
    `directory["/tmp/monkey"]` resource, based on the directories
    current state (which goes in `@current_resource`).
3.  Call `action_create`, which is responsible making sure the directory
    exists, and that it's attributes are correct.
4.  If we changed the directory in any way, we mark the resource as
    updated.

That's it!

How do I write new Providers?
-----------------------------

If you want to write your own providers for resources that don't exist
in Chef, you can use [Lightweight Resources and Providers
(LWRP)](Lightweight%20Resources%20and%20Providers%20(LWRP).html "Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRP)")
in your cookbook(s).

If you want to write a new provider for Chef itself and contribute to
the project, that's awesome! We will help you out as much as we can. Go
read the [instructions for how to
contribute](How%20to%20Contribute.html "How to Contribute") to an
Opscode project, hop on [the Chef IRC channel](IRC.html "IRC"), and get
started.
