Signup and Account Validation
-----------------------------

Head over to the [Hosted Chef Sign Up
page](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/) to create your account. You
will get an email validation shortly after you sign up.  
 After you validate your email address with Hosted Chef, you need to do
the following:

-   Download your User Key, which you will use to interact with Hosted
    Chef directly.
-   Create an organization on Hosted Chef
-   Download your Organization Key, which will be used to associate new
    nodes with your Organization. (Also sometimes called a validation
    key).
-   Download a Knife configuration file, which will configure our
    command line tools for you.

Each of these steps are detailed below. Place all of the files you
download in this section in the same directory.
