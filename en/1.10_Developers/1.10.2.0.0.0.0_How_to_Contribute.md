FAQ

### Licensing and copyright

* * * * *

#### *Why is your software Apache Licensed?*

Opscode uses the [Apache License Version
2](Apache%20License.html "Apache License") because it provides the same
level of freedom for our users that we desire for ourselves. Based upon
the [Apache Licensing
FAQ](http://apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html#WhatDoesItMEAN)...

###### It allows you to:

-   freely download and use Opscode software, in whole or in part, for
    personal, company internal, or commercial purposes;
-   use Opscode software in packages or distributions that you create.

###### It **forbids** you to:

-   redistribute any piece of Opscode-originated software without proper
    attribution;
-   use any marks owned by Opscode in any way that might state or imply
    that Opscode endorses your distribution;
-   use any marks owned by Opscode in any way that might state or imply
    that you created the Opscode software in question.

###### It **requires** you to:

-   include a copy of the license in any redistribution you may make
    that includes Opscode software;
-   provide clear attribution to Opscode for any distributions that
    include Opscode software.

###### It **does not require** you to:

-   include the source of the Opscode software itself, or of any
    modifications you may have made to it, in any redistribution you may
    assemble that includes it;
-   submit changes that you make to the software back to Opscode (though
    such feedback is encouraged).

###### From The Opscode Blog

**[Why We Chose the Apache
License](http://blog.opscode.com/blog/2009/08/11/why-we-chose-the-apache-license/)**

  
It is our goal to run a successful, truly open source business.   
  
*To that end, we are protecting our own rights by making them explicit
in our choice of licensing: you have the same rights to our open source
software that we do.*

  

#### *How should I update the header file of my contribution to properly credit earlier contributors and recognize copyrights?*

You need to put attribution about the origins of some of the code in the
NOTICE file for your app. On an individual header, you can add yourself
as an author/copyright holder, placing text in the header file saying
that your new work is based on previous work, and referencing the
original header below.

If the original file is lacking the license header, please [let us
know](mailto:legal@opscode.com), so we can add one. Even in their
absence, they are covered by the [Apache 2
license](Apache%20License.html "Apache License").

#### *Do I need the agreement of anyone else whose authorship/copyright I come across?*

You can re-use the work without having to get the agreement of the
original authors, as long as

1.  you're not going to be changing the licensing terms at all (ie: you
    maintain and fulfill [Apache 2 licensing
    requirements](Apache%20License.html "Apache License")) **and**
2.  you don't modify the fact that the code you are incorporating
    remains copyrighted by the original authors.

The [Apache License](Apache%20License.html "Apache License") grants
these rights to those who receive a copy of the software.

### CLAs and CCLAs

* * * * *

#### *Why do I need to fill out a CLA?*

The
[CLA](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PJIF5694K6L)
(and
[CCLA](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PIE6C7AX856))
makes everyone's rights clear. It states:

-   You grant copyright license for your contributions to Opscode
-   You grant patent license for your contributions to Opscode
-   Your contribution is entirely voluntary
-   Your work is your original creation
-   You are not required to provide support for your contributions

You should read and understand the entire CLA before signing it. *Our
description of it is not legally binding.*

The CLA is beneficial to our contributors and users because:

-   It ensures that we will always be able to release our projects, free
    from any individual contributor revoking our rights to distribute
    their contribution.  
    *This also means that, if you fork an Opscode project, or utilize it
    in a commercial product, you know that you are clear of patent and
    copyright issues*.
-   It makes clear what is required of our contributors.

The most important thing about the CLA is that it doesn't give Opscode
any special rights - it just makes things more explicit.

#### *Can you accept my contribution without a CLA (I'll sign it later, I promise!)?*

No. We must have a signed CLA before we can merge your changes to any of
our projects.

#### *When do I need to have my company sign a CCLA?*

If you are contributing to an Opscode project while doing work on
company time, or utilizing company resources, you should have your
company sign a CCLA.

#### *How do I add additional employees to my existing CCLA?*

The point of contact from your CCLA should email
[legal@opscode.com](mailto:legal@opscode.com) with the full name and
email address of the individuals account on
[tickets.opscode.com](http://tickets.opscode.com) that they would like
added.

#### *How do I change the point of contact on my existing CCLA?*

If you need to update the point of contact for the CCLA, the current
contact should email [legal@opscode.com](mailto:legal@opscode.com) with
the full name and email address of the new contact. If the existing
contact is no longer available, please [contact
us](mailto:support@opscode.com) and we will help you out.

### Contribution Process

* * * * *

#### *Contribute Changes to Opscode-Managed Apache Licensed Cookbooks at the Community Site. All other cookbooks require no CLA*

Once you have signed a CLA and have a ticket referencing your request,
use [Contribute A
Cookbook](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Site+Help#CookbookSiteHelp-AddingaCookbooktotheCommunitySite)
to upload cookbooks to the community site.

#### *Do I have to use* *[GitHub](http://www.github.com)* *for my fork of the repository?*

Nope - but it makes everyone's lives easier if you do. We'll be happy to
pull from any repository you like.

#### *Why do I need to have a* *[ticket](http://tickets.opscode.com)* *associated with my patch?*

Because it helps us coordinate the changelog for future releases, and
provides for [recognizing community
participation](Release%20MVPs.html "Release MVPs").

#### *You use GitHub, why don't you use GitHub Pull Requests?*

We use JIRA for our [open source projects](http://tickets.opscode.com)
and for our own internal projects: managing all the details of the code
base, and fulfilling license requirements for our joint benefit. We also
interact regularly with the GitHub issues/pull request system. **You are
welcome to open a pull request, and link to that when updating the [Jira
ticket](http://tickets.opscode.com) for a contribution.**
