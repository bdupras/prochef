401 Unauthorized (using node's API client)
------------------------------------------

**Note:** This error is very similar to the error in the next section.
If you see a line that states c:/chef/client.pem is not present, follow
the directions in the next section for 401 Unauthorized (using validator
API client) instead. NODENAME below could be any name, but will never be
ORGANIZATION-validator like the error in the next section.

Error on Hosted Chef:

    $ sudo chef-client
    [Tue, 01 Nov 2011 16:54:29 -0700] INFO: *** Chef 10.X.X ***
    [Tue, 01 Nov 2011 16:54:30 -0700] FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /var/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
    [Tue, 01 Nov 2011 16:54:30 -0700] FATAL: Net::HTTPServerException: 401 "Unauthorized"

Error on Open Source Chef:

    [Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:10:11 -0400] INFO: *** Chef 10.X.X ***
    [Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:10:12 -0400] INFO: HTTP Request Returned 401 Unauthorized: Failed to authenticate. Ensure that your client key is valid.
    [Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:10:12 -0400] FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /var/cache/chef/chef-stacktrace.out
    [Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:10:12 -0400] FATAL: Net::HTTPServerException: 401 "Unauthorized"

**Fix:**  
 This error can typically happen for 1 of 3 reasons:

-   **1. Your** `client.pem` **file is incorrect.**  
     This can be fixed by deleting `client.pem` in /etc/chef, deleting
    the client and node with knife, and re-running chef-client:

    **Saving your Node Data**  
    The following directions involve deleting the data associated with
    this node. If the node attributes or run\_list would be hard to
    recreate, you may want to save them:

        knife node show NODENAME -Fj > NODENAME.json

##### on management station

    knife client delete NODENAME
    knife node delete NODENAME

##### on affected node:

    sudo rm /etc/chef/client.pem
    sudo chef-client

When chef-client runs, it will register the API client and generate the
correct key.

-   **2. You are trying to authenticate with a node\_name that is
    different from the one you used on your first chef-client run.**  
     This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, if your
    `client.rb` file does not specify your node name and you have
    recently changed the systems hostname. Running chef client with
    debug logging will allow you to see the node name the client is
    trying to authenticate with:

        [Wed, 05 Oct 2011 22:05:35 +0000] DEBUG: Signing the request as SOMENODENAMEHERE

    You can fix this by explicitly setting the node name in the
    `client.rb` file or with chef-client's `-N` option to match the name
    originally used to register. Alternatively, you can re-register
    using the method described above.

-   **3. If you are using Hosted Chef, your node name matches another
    users username on the platform.**  
     This issue is documented here:
    [http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2240](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2240).
    If you have unsuccessfully attempted the solutions above, click the
    Help link from
    [http://manage.opscode.com](http://manage.opscode.com) and request
    an analyst to verify this is the issue. To rename the node without
    changing the hostname, follow these steps:
    -   Capture you node data by either

            $ knife node show SOMENODENAMEHERE -Fj > somefile.chef

        or by

            $ knife node edit SOMENODENAMEHERE

        and copy/paste.

    -   Delete the node, client and client.pem on the node.
        -   $ knife node delete SOMENODENAMEHERE

        -   $ knife client delete SOMENODENAMEHERE

        -   On the node to be renamed:

                $ sudo rm /etc/chef/client.pem

    -   Run the chef client on the node and specify the new node name:

            $ sudo chef-client -N SOME_NEW_NODENAMEHERE

    -   Replace your node data
    -   Run the chef-client again (and in all future instances) as

            $ sudo chef-client -N SOME_NEW_NODENAMEHERE

        or add

            node_name SOME_NEW_NODENAMEHERE

        to the /etc/chef/client.rb file.

To rename your node by changing the host name, delete the node,client
and client.pem as described above, change the hostname on the host and
run the chef-client as normal.
