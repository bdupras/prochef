#### Summary of discussions:

-   Round trip to chef server to test cookbooks is expensive
-   It is possible to push broken code to the server
-   Would be nice to check things for correctness before upload
    -   Is our Ruby code valid?
    -   Do our resource blocks & attributes validate against their
        specs?
    -   Basic Json syntax checking
    -   Do we have at least default attributes for everything?

-   Would be nice to be able to run a partial chef run (one cookbook or
    even one resource)
-   Lint checking should be on by default with a flag to turn off
-   Don't throw away all edits to a node when the json isn't quit right

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

Let's create a basic lint check & continually improve it
