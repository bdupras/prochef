Anatomy of a Chef Run
=====================

#### **As you work with Chef, it will be important to understand the path we take during execution of the [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client").**

Convergence
-----------

We call the process of running the [Chef
Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") or [Chef
Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo") and taking any needed actions on
[Resources](Resources.html "Resources") "Convergence". In a nutshell,
Convergence in systems automation speak means "bringing the system
closer to correct with each action you take". Ideally, a single run of
the [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") should always bring
the system into the fully expected state - not just half-way. But if it
doesn't work out, trying again should continue to bring the system
closer to correct.

### Build, Register, and Authenticate the Node

#### Build the Node

The first thing [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") or [Chef
Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo") does is build a new
[Node](Nodes.html "Nodes"). The node is constructed from:

1.  1.  [Ohai](Ohai.html "Ohai") - Ohai discovers the data about the
        Operating System first.
    2.  The previous data for the node is fetched from the [Chef
        Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") (unless we are running
        under [Chef Solo](Chef%20Solo.html "Chef Solo")).
    3.  Any JSON [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") or
        [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") are added.
    4.  All the Ohai attributes are added.

#### Registering With The Chef Server

Once the initial [node](Nodes.html "Nodes") is constructed, the [Chef
Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") checks for the existence of
its private key file, usually located in `/etc/chef/client.pem`. If the
private key does not exist, the client will attempt to register itself.
To register itself, the client temporarily assumes the identity of the
*chef-validator* client. *chef-validator* is a special purpose client
used exclusively for registering new clients. By default, the private
key for *chef-validator* is stored in `/etc/chef/validation.pem`. Using
the identity of the *chef-validator* chef-client (the application) will
register a new client identity with the server and store its private key
in `/etc/chef/client.pem`. From this point forward, chef-client will
authenticate with the server using its own identity.

### Synchronize Cookbooks

#### Synchronize Libraries, Attributes, Definitions and Recipes

The [Chef Client](Chef%20Client.html "Chef Client") then queries the
[Chef Server](Chef%20Server.html "Chef Server") for a list of all the
[Libraries](Libraries.html "Libraries"),
[Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes"),
[Definitions](Definitions.html "Definitions") and
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") in all
[Cookbooks](Cookbooks.html "Cookbooks"), and transfers them to the local
file cache.

Compile - Resource Collection
-----------------------------

Now that we have all information from the Cookbooks, it's time to
assemble the specific collection of resources needed to converge this
node.

#### Load Libraries

We first load all the [Libraries](Libraries.html "Libraries") from every
cookbook, making any language extensions or ruby classes available.

#### Load Attributes

Then we load all the [Attribute](Attributes.html "Attributes") files,
which update the [Node](Nodes.html "Nodes") attributes and
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes").

#### Load Definitions

[Definitions](Definitions.html "Definitions") must be loaded before
[Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes"), since they create new
pseudo-[Resources](Resources.html "Resources").

#### Load Recipes

At this point, the [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") themselves are
evaluated. We are not taking any action on the resources in the recipes
at this stage - we are taking each evaluated
[resource](Resources.html "Resources") and putting it in the **Resource
Collection**.

-   This is essentially an Array of each evaluated
    [resource](Resources.html "Resources"), along with some helpful
    functions.
-   Plain Ruby code outside of resources is evaluated, however.
-   If you would like Ruby code executed with other resources, use a
    [Ruby Block Resource](Resources.html#Resources-RubyBlock).
-   **You can have Chef [Evaluate and Run Resources at Compile
    Time](Evaluate%20and%20Run%20Resources%20at%20Compile%20Time.html "Evaluate and Run Resources at Compile Time"),
    too.**

Execute - Configure Node
------------------------

Now Chef is ready to configure the system.

#### Converge

This is the actual convergence step. Each
[Resource](Resources.html "Resources") in the Resource Collection is
mapped to a [Provider](Providers.html "Providers"), which then takes
Action on it. The system is configured.

#### Save Node

After converging, Chef saves the state of the node to persist its node
data and make it available for [search](Search.html "Search").

#### Run Notifications

Finally, any [notification
handlers](Exception%20and%20Report%20Handlers.html "Exception and Report Handlers")
you've configured will be run.

If Something Went Wrong...
--------------------------

When chef-client fails, it finishes the run by executing any [exception
handlers](Exception%20and%20Report%20Handlers.html "Exception and Report Handlers")
you've configured.

  
  
  
  

  

Just wondering if there is a specific reason why templates are not
synchronized alongside the cookbook libraries, attributes, definitions
and recipes? I think it would be a nice feature if these were synced as
well.
