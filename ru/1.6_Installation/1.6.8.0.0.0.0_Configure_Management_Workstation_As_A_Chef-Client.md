Having Chef Manage the Configuration of your Management Workstation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To have the Chef Server (or Hosted Chef, as the case may be) manage the
configuration of your workstation, you need to configure the client.
These directions assume you have already installed knife by following
the [Installation](Installation.html "Installation") Guides.

    $ cd ~/chef-repo
    $ knife configure client ./client-config
    INFO: Creating client configuration
    INFO: Writing client.rb
    INFO: Writing validation.pem

You'll now have a client-config directory in your local repository:

    $ ls -l client-config
    -rw-r--r--   1 adam  staff   155 Jun 18 16:03 client.rb
    -rw-r--r--@  1 adam  staff  1679 Jun 18 16:03 validation.pem

To configure your workstation as a chef client, you just need to copy
this directory to /etc/chef:

    $ sudo mkdir /etc/chef 
    $ sudo cp -r ~/chef-repo/client-config/* /etc/chef
