Fast Start Guide for Windows
============================

  

![image](../attachments/19071092/21463244.png)

* * * * *

##### This page is an install guide that describes how to get up and running with Hosted Chef as quickly as possible and ends with a fast demonstration on how to work with cookbooks.

* * * * *

##### This Installation Guide uses the *new* Windows Full Installer.

Hosted and Private Chef customers should contact
[support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com) with any issues. Open
Source users may interact in [open source support
channels](Support.html "Support"), open a [Bug
Report](http://tickets.opscode.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) with project
"CHEF", component "Packages", label "omnibus", if necessary.

If you want to install Chef manually instead, see the
[Installation](Installation.html "Installation") page.

  

Assumptions
===========

In order to make this as quick as possible, we make a few assumptions.
*If your system does not meet these assumptions, you will need to use
the* *[Installation](Installation.html "Installation")* *instructions
that apply for the "flavor" of Chef you are installing.*

### Hosted Chef

We're using [Hosted Chef](http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/) so we can
get started right away without setting up a Chef Server. *If you want to
set up your own server instead, head over to the
[Installation](Installation.html "Installation") page.*
