<h1><a name="CookbookSupport-Whatdistributionsandreleasesdowesupport%3F"></a>What distributions and releases do we support?</h1>

<p>Declaring specific distribution support across the board is difficult. Every platform has differing opinions and implementations of the software our cookbooks install and configure. </p>

<p><font color="#f7681a"><b>Any cookbook that Opscode releases will indicate the platforms it supports</b></font>. For supported platforms: Opscode personnel have converged a node of that platform by following the instructions in the cookbook's documentation, and validated the functionality provided by the cookbook is implemented. </p>

<p>Cookbooks are documented with a README file in the root of the cookbook, which is distributed in the downloadable archive file. For example:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<div id="root">

<p><em><font color="navy"><b>We <ins>focus</ins> cookbook supportability on the following platforms and versions</b></font></em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu (10.04, 11.04, 11.10)</li>
	<li>Debian (5.0, 6.0)</li>
	<li>RHEL / CentOS (5.x, 6.x)</li>
	<li>Fedora 14+</li>
	<li>Mac OS X (10.5+)</li>
	<li>Windows 7</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008 R2</li>
</ul>


<p>As time progresses, older versions of distributions may be removed from support in the cookbook without warning.</p>

<p><em><font color="navy"><b>Platform versions not explicitly stated above may (or may not) function as expected</b></font></em></p>

<p>Opscode has simply not <em>tested and validated functionality</em> on all possible platforms beyond those listed above. The Opscode cookbooks may require modifications for full functionality on alternate platforms, and on those platforms we cannot guarantee any particular functionality or clean exit. </p>

<p>Also, some cookbooks may not be relevant for a particular platform. (For example, you can add "<tt>recipe[iis]</tt>" to an Ubuntu node, and it will fail to converge.) <em>It is up to the customer to understand the purpose of the cookbooks they're adding to their nodes.</em> (i.e.: "This stuff runs as root!")</p>

<p><b>As part of ongoing maintenance of the Cookbooks, Opscode may add functionality for other platforms to existing cookbooks.</b> <font color="#f7681a">The supported platforms will always be included in the cookbook README and metadata.</font> <em>It is up to the customer to read the cookbook's documentation and note the supported platforms listed in the README and the cookbook metadata.</em> If a customer or user of a cookbook has a modification that would provide additional functionality, or extend the cookbook to an alternate platform, we'd be happy to included it - please see the next section for how to contribute that change.</p>
