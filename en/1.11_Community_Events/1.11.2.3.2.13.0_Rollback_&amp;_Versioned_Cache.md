#### Summary of discussions:

-   discussed the feasability of rollback as a general whole, seemed to
    be consensus that it's really hard
-   most of the time you don't need it
-   "roll forward bro"
-   a few participants agreed it would be nice to have naive rollback
-   the use case discussed was "template update triggers a service
    reload which fails, let's try to restore the old template and notify
    again before throwing stack"
-   discussed throwing all of /var/cache/chef under version control, ie.
    commit the entire state of the cache after each chef run
-   discussion degenerated, msf trolls adam about CHEF-13
-   bikeshed about NOOP ensues
-   most people want dry-run so we can a text representation about what
    actions are about to occur and perhaps diffs of what is going to
    change in the filesystem. a "pre-flight" check.
-   we discovered most of the people who want this don't run the
    chef-client as a daemon, usually resulting in much larger changesets
    if the client is run infrequently.

#### What will we do now? What needs to happen next?

have more arguments I suppose...
