#### Chef’s documentation is vast and broken up into many pages on the Opscode wiki   
  
 The goal here is to index this information and give a brief explanation of each topic

Architecture
============

[http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Architecture](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Architecture)

Chef is a configuration management platform in the same class of tools
as Cfengine, Bcfg2, and Puppet. The idea is to define policy at a
centralized, version controlled place, and then have the machines under
management pull down their policy and converge onto that state at
regular intervals. This gives you a single point of administration
allowing for easier change management and disaster recovery. Combined
with a compute resource provisioning layer (such as knife’s ability to
manipulate EC2 or Rackspace servers), entire complex infrastructures can
pop into existence in minutes.

Chef Server
===========

[http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Server](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Server)

Chef server has various components under the hood. Assorted information
(cookbooks, databags, client certificates, and node objects), are stored
in CouchDB as JSON blobs. CouchDB is indexed by chef-solr-indexer.
RabbitMQ sits between the data store and A RESTful API service that
exposes all this to the network as chef-server. If you don’t want to run
chef-server yourself, Opscode will do it for you for with their Hosted
Chef service for a pittance. The management console is really handy
during development since it provides a nice way to examine JSON data.
However, it should be noted that real chefs value knife techniques.
