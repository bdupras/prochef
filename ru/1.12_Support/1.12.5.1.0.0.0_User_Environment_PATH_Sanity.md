User Environment PATH Sanity
============================

  

  

##### As mentioned on the [Installation](Installation.html "Installation") page, you need to have a sane PATH set up.

Neither Chef nor Ohai hardcodes paths when running system commands,
because we don't want to make assumptions about where programs might
live for every single platform. For most Unix and Linux systems, the
following should cover everything that we'll need to run for
[Providers](Providers.html "Providers") or [Ohai
Plugins](Writing%20Ohai%20Plugins.html "Writing Ohai Plugins").   
  

**$PATH in Bourne shell derivatives**

    export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

A Note About Sudoers
====================

[This
comment](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-87?focusedCommentId=11238&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_11238)
on [OHAI-87](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-87) is worth
repeating here, and may be applicable on other systems that do an
env\_reset in /etc/sudoers.

The main issue is the default /etc/sudoers on CentOS does an env\_reset,
and if the user's PATH is reset to "/usr/bin:/bin". To fix for the local
user, add "/usr/sbin:/sbin" to the user's PATH, and run sudo with -E.

    echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
    sudo -E chef-client

Chef/Ohai work fine when executed by a default root shell on CentOS.
Also note that Opscode's sudo cookbook will overwrite sudoers without
the env\_reset, so once the user's PATH is set, sudo won't strip it on
execution.

**Chef 0.10.0 Client Enforces Path Sanity**  
  
 As of Chef 0.10.0, chef-client will enforce path sanity by default. If
you don't want this, you can turn it off with enforce\_path\_sanity
false in your config file.
