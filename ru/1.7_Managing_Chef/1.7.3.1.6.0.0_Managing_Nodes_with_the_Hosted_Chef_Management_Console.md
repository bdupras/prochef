Listing Nodes in the Organization

**Note:** If a specific environment is selected on the top of the page,
then only the nodes in that environment will be shown. You also need
[list
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global nodes level to list the nodes.

Viewing a Node
--------------

Viewing a node shows the recipes and roles in the node's run list, as
well as the node's attributes.

In order to view a specific node:

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization to use if
you are associated with multiple organizations.

2. Click on the *Nodes* tab.

3. Click on the name of the node you want to view.

On this page you can see the roles and recipes in the node's run list,
as well as an expandable tree view of the JSON attributes on the node.

**Note:** You need [read
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the node to view it.

Creating a Node
---------------

The node create page lists all available recipes and roles in the
organization, and allows you to include these in the run list of the
node you are creating. There is also a JSON editor for editing, adding
and removing the node's attributes.

A node is also created the first time you run chef-client, or when you
use [Knife Bootstrap](Knife%20Bootstrap.html "Knife Bootstrap")
commands.

In order to create a node through the Management Console:

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization.

2. Click on the *Nodes* tab.

3. Click *Create* on the sub navigation bar.

4. Give the node a name and select an Environment for the node.

5. Edit the node, further information is in the [next
section](#ManagingNodeswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-EditingaNode).
Click *Create Node* to save the new node when you are done.

**Note:** You need [create
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the global nodes level to create a node.

Editing a Node
--------------

1. Login to the [Hosted Chef Management
Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization.

2. Select the *Nodes* tab.

3. Click on the *Edit* link next to the node you want to edit.

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")

### Moving a Node to an Environment

You can move the node to an environment with the drop down box on the
top of this page. More information on this can be found on the [Managing
Environments](Managing%20Environments%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html#ManagingEnvironmentswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-MovingaNodetoanEnvironment)
page.

### Modifying Node Attributes

To modify the [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") of a node, such
that they override the values of the included recipe or role, you can
use the *Editor* or *Source* tabs on this page. With the *Editor* tab
you can edit the attributes by selecting the location on the tree and
adding the details. You can use the *Source* tab to paste in JSON
directly.

**Note:** You need [update
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the node to edit the attributes.

#### Using the *Editor* tab

1. Select "json" from the tree on the left and click on the *Editor* tab
on the right.

2. Push the green add button under the *Editor* tab:

editor.

Console](http://manage.opscode.com) and select an organization.

2. Click on the *Nodes* tab.

2. Click the *Delete* link next to the name of the node you want to
delete, and click *OK* on the confirmation message box. Or, click the
link of the node to view its details, and click *Delete* on the sub
navigation menu.

**Note:** You need [delete
permissions](Managing%20Permissions%20with%20the%20Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console")
on the node to delete it. If you don't have this permission, you may not
see a *Delete* link or tab.

Checking Node Status

Node status such as platform, FQDN, IP Address, up time, last check-in
time, and run list can be checked on the Management Console.

In order to check node status:

Console](http://manage.opscode.com).
