Install Ruby and other Dependencies
-----------------------------------

Chef is written in Ruby and thus requires Ruby as well as other system
dependencies to run. Run the following command to install ruby and other
required dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev libopenssl-ruby rdoc ri irb build-essential wget ssl-cert curl

**Chef 10.X Note**  
There are open issues with Chef 10.x and Ruby 1.8.6. If you are using
Chef 10.x, you should get 1.8.7 with SSL bindings. If you'd like to use
1.9.1 or 1.9.2, you'll want to follow the [Installing Chef Client on
Other Operating
Systems](Installing%20Chef%20Client%20on%20Other%20Operating%20Systems.html "Installing Chef Client on Other Operating Systems")
directions to install manually with gems.
