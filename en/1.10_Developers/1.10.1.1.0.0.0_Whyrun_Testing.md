Whyrun Testing
==============

Whyrun
======

A beta release of whyrun was first released on 2012-07-03 in Chef
10.14.0.beta.1. That [beta
announcement](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-07/msg00025.html)
contains some useful backstory about whyrun and explanation of its
usage.

In short, whyrun tells you why Chef would make changes to your system,
without executing the changes. It is comparable to a noop or dryrun
mode. However, modifying system state has side-effects. For instance,
installing a package might also start a service. Thus when we examine
what each resource would do individually we fail to acknowledge that
there are relationships between resources. Because side-effects are
difficult are model, whyrun makes certain assumptions about them to help
predict you predict what would happen, and why. Which is exactly what
you're asking of it.

Testing
=======

Whyrun is built into the core providers which was a significant
engineering undertaking. Because each environment is different (e.g.
platform, cookbooks) it is important for many users to test whyrun to
confirm that there is full coverage for their use case.

To help, start by installing Chef with through gems so you can install a
pre-release gem.

[Installing Omnibus Chef Client on Linux and
Mac](Installing%20Omnibus%20Chef%20Client%20on%20Linux%20and%20Mac.html "Installing Omnibus Chef Client on Linux and Mac")
\# Then run: sudo /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install chef --pre
--no-rdoc --no-ri  
[Installing Chef Client on Other Operating
Systems](Installing%20Chef%20Client%20on%20Other%20Operating%20Systems.html "Installing Chef Client on Other Operating Systems")
\# Then run: sudo gem install chef --pre --no-rdoc --no-ri  
[Installing Chef Client on
Windows](Installing%20Chef%20Client%20on%20Windows.html "Installing Chef Client on Windows")
\# Then run: gem install chef --pre --no-rdoc --no-ri

**Rubygems arguments**  
--pre installs a prerelease version of a gem  
 --no-ri prevents generation of the RI docs (faster install, less
space)  
 --no-doc prevents generation of the RDoc docs (faster install, less
space)

Run Chef with --why-run and a typical run list for you or find some
cookbooks from the [community site](http://community.opscode.com) to try
out. Report back here or send an email to the [chef mailing
list](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef) if you have questions. If
you want to try Chef on some other systems and you have an EC2 account
check out the [AMI List for
Developers](AMI%20List%20for%20Developers.html "AMI List for Developers").

If your run list has many resources that are going to change the system,
you'll see quite a bit of output and Chef is likely to not be able to
model the possible side-effects. Do a regular run (using the nice new
output formatters like '-Fdoc -lfatal'!), change something and try
whyrun again.

    knife ec2 server create -I ami-b89842d1 -x ubuntu
    ssh ubuntu@ec2-x-x-x-x.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    sudo /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install chef --pre --no-ri --no-rdoc
    sudo chef-client -o recipe['wordpress'] --why-run
    sudo chef-client -Fdoc -lfatal

Test Results
============

An initial list of platforms has been from an old table, but feel free
to add others. If someone else has already tested the same platform but
you test it under different circumstances, like a different run list,
please add a duplicate line right below it.

If you find a place where why-run breaks down, please [file a
bug](http://tickets.opscode.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10000&issuetype=1&Create=Create).
Set the 'Affects Version' field to 10.14.0 (it is under 'Unreleased
Versions in the drop down) Most importantly, make sure to **set a label
of 'whyrun'** so we can find the related bugs. See
[CHEF-3319](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3319) for an example.
Whyrun will never be able to survive every complex run, but we'll triage
the bugs for ones that we think we can fix.
