Vagrant
=======

  

### [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments.

##### Vagrant can be a great way to leverage production Chef cookbooks in development and test/qa. It can also be a great way to develop and test new cookbooks on a local workstation.

**Warning**  
This page assumes you are using [Vagrant
0.7+](http://vagrantup.com/docs/changes/changes_06x_07x.html) and
[VirtualBox 4+](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Please be
sure to update both before proceeding. The Vagrantfile Provisioner
syntax has undergone massive changes so be sure to not use the following
Vagrantfile with older versions of Vagrant.

  

Using Vagrant with Hosted Chef
==============================

*(formerly the Opscode Platform)*

The following Vagrantfile can be used to connect a Vagrant instance to
Hosted Chef:

    # Before running vagrant, export the shell variable for the organization on Hosted Chef and
    # make sure the validator certificate is in ~/.chef.
    #
    # export ORGNAME=your_platform_organization
    #
    # Also be sure to export the shell variable for the vagrant box (linux flavor) you will be using
    #
    # export VAGRANT_BOX=ubuntu10.04-gems
    #
    # You can optionally export a shell variable for your Chef server username if it is different
    # from your OS user export OPSCODE_USER=bofh

    user = ENV['OPSCODE_USER'] || ENV['USER']
    base_box = ENV['VAGRANT_BOX'] || 'lucid32'

    Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
      config.vm.box = base_box

      config.vm.provision :chef_client do |chef|

        # Set up some organization specific values based on environment variable above.
        chef.chef_server_url = "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/#{ENV['ORGNAME']}"
        chef.validation_key_path = "#{ENV['HOME']}/.chef/#{ENV['ORGNAME']}-validator.pem"
        chef.validation_client_name = "#{ENV['ORGNAME']}-validator"

        # Change the node/client name for the Chef Server
        chef.node_name = "#{user}-vagrant"

        # Put the client.rb in /etc/chef so chef-client can be run w/o specifying
        chef.provisioning_path = "/etc/chef"

        # logging
        chef.log_level = :info

        # adjust the run list to suit your testing needs
        chef.run_list = [
          "recipe[some_cookbook::some_recipe]"
          "role[some_role]"
        ]
      end
    end

This Vagrantfile requires the export of the following environment
variables before using it:

-   **ORGNAME** = your Hosted Chef organization name.
-   **VAGRANT\_BOX** = the vagrant box you will be using. More
    information about Vagrant Boxes can be found in the [Vagrant
    documentation](http://vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html).

-   **[Getting Started With
    Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/why.html)**  
     Vagrant uses Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox to create its virtual machines and
    then uses Chef to provision them.
