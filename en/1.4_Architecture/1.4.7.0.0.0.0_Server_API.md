Server API
==========

  

Overview
========

##### This page serves as an overview of the Chef Server REST API, and on managing [API clients](API%20Clients.html "API Clients") through this Server API.

API Clients can also be managed via [Knife](Knife.html "Knife") or the
[Open Source Chef Server Management
Console](Open%20Source%20Chef%20Server%20Management%20Console.html "Open Source Chef Server Management Console"),
see [API Clients](API%20Clients.html "API Clients") for documentation on
those approaches, and
[Authentication](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Authentication "Authentication")
for the process of authentication and validation of the clients access
to the server.

**There are requirements in order to interact with the Chef Server REST
API.** In order to make any of these API calls, you will need to satisfy
these pre-requisites:

-   Have Chef 0.9.x or above
-   Set your Accept header to "application/json"
-   Set your X-Chef-Version header to the version of the API you are
    using
-   Sign your request with Mixlib::Authentication

The easiest way to ensure a well formatted request is to use the
Chef::REST library bundled with Chef. See the
[Authentication](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Authentication "Authentication")
page for more information about Chef's authentication mechanism.

  

Clients
=======

API Clients communicate with the Chef Server via REST, authenticates via
Signed Header Authentication, and compiles and executes Cookbooks.

/clients
--------

Manipulate or create API Clients.

### HTTP Methods

#### GET

registration for each Chef node, any other API users you may create, and
the validation and webui clients.

##### Response

**Hosted and Private Chef**  
The Hosted and Private Chef APIs are compatible with the Chef Server API
described in this article.

Doesn't seem like setting "attributes" on a put does anything in the
current version of Chef - setting  
 "normal" seems to set the node attributes though, e.g.:

{  
 "name": "latte",  
 "chef\_type": "node",  
 "json\_class": "Chef::Node",  
 "normal": {   
 "hardware\_type": "laptop"   
 },  
 "overrides": {  
 },  
 "defaults": {  
 },  
 "run\_list": [ "recipe[unicorn]" ]  
 }

Actually results in the hardware\_type getting permanently added to the
node's attributes.
