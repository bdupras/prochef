### This article explains how to setup a Chef Workstation on Linux or OS X using Omnibus.

  
 A **Chef workstation** is where you develop cookbooks, and interact
with your chef-server and nodes.  
**Omnibus** is a quick install method that installs an embedded version
of Ruby, Rubygems and other dependencies.

  
**Such a workstation typically includes:**

-   A local repository of your cookbooks and possibly other data.
-   A well-configured knife client

**To create such a workstation, this article explains how to**

-   Install Ruby and other Chef dependencies
-   Install Chef
-   Install Git
-   Create a bare-bones chef repository
-   Configure Knife

Install Chef
------------

The [Chef Full Installer](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install) has been
tested with Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Oracle Linux,
Scientific Linux, and OS X.

You can install it by entering this command:

    sudo true && curl -L http://opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash

Once it is installed there will be no icon for it. If needed, you can
confirm it was installed correctly with these commands in a new command
prompt window:

    % chef-client -v

You should see "10.12.0" returned as the version number.

**Get the error "Could not find RubyGem chef" instead?**  
  
 If you get an error that looks similar to the one below, you most
likely have an issue with how your RVM is setup.

    /opt/opscode/embedded/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:762:in report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem chef (>= 0) (Gem::LoadError)

You can work around the environment variables RVM has setup by always
using 'sudo -i' with the chef-client command. For instance, this would
correctly return the version number:

    % sudo -i chef-client -v

Upon installation, this script will:

-   Install all of the embedded dependencies for Chef
-   Install an embedded version of Ruby and Rubygems
-   Install chef-client and knife version 10.12.0

**Looking for a walkthrough that will also explain how to use
cookbooks?**  
  
 You may want to try the [Fast Start
Guide](Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Fast Start Guide") instead or look at
the [Client Bootstrap Fast Start
Guide](Client%20Bootstrap%20Fast%20Start%20Guide.html "Client Bootstrap Fast Start Guide")
after finishing your workstation install. They also use the Omnibus
method of installation, but end in a short walkthrough on using
cookbooks and running them on your nodes.
