Search on the Management Console
================================

  

### You can view search indexes and search for nodes, API clients, roles, and data bags on the Management Console.

Viewing Available Search Indexes
--------------------------------

In order to view available search indexes:

Log on to the Management Console and click the `Search` tab.

The search indexes should be listed. Nodes, Roles, and Clients are
always available. Data bags are indexed by the data bag's name.

Searching
---------

The query syntax described in the [Search](Search.html "Search") page
also applies to the Management Console. The very basic syntax is
"attribute:value". If you do not enter anything in any search box, it
searches for everything ("\*:\*").

For more information, please read the Query Syntax section in the
[Search](Search.html "Search") page.
