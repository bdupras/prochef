 Mixlib::Log provides a mixin for enabling a class based logger object,
a-la Merb, Chef, and Nanite. To use it:

    require 'mixlib/log'

    class Log
      extend Mixlib::Log
    end

You can then do:

    Log.debug("foo")
    Log.info("bar")
    Log.warn("baz") 
    Log.error("baz")
    Log.fatal("wewt")

By default, `Mixlib::Logger` logs to STDOUT. To alter this, you should
call `Log.init`, passing any arguments to the standard Ruby Logger.

For example:

    Log.init("/tmp/logfile")
    # log to /tmp/logfile

    Log.init("/tmp/logfile", 7)
    # log to /tmp/logfile, rotate every day Enjoy!
