### A node is a host that runs the Chef client. The primary features of a node, from Chef's point of view, are its [Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes") and its run list. Nodes are the thing that [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") and [Roles](Roles.html "Roles") are applied to.   
  
 In practice, there is usually a one-to-one mapping between a node and a physical device (a computer, a switch, a router, etc.), but in special cases a system may execute the recipes for multiple nodes.

  

Components of a Node
--------------------

A node is made up of two prime components: a Run List and
[Attributes](Attributes.html "Attributes").   
 The Run List is an ordered list of [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes") or
[Roles](Roles.html "Roles") to run. [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes")
are the fundamental building block of Chef - they define the resources
you want managed, in the order you want them managed.
[Roles](Roles.html "Roles") are ordered lists of other
[Roles](Roles.html "Roles") and [Recipes](Recipes.html "Recipes"),
expanded at run time. Attributes are data about your node - things like
the network interfaces, file systems, or how many clients your Apache
server can accept.

It's probably worth noting that the chef client has the following
default in /etc/chef/client.rb:  

    openid_url         "https://chef.yourdomainhere.com:444"

If for some crazy reason, you have any firewall or iptables rules setup
between your chef server and clients, you're probably going to want to
open port 444 for your clients to successfully connect for validating
registration. I've got some restrictive default iptables rules on my
servers, and this caught me.

You can get the authoritative name of a node (the name that can be used
as a handle for editing or deleting the node) with

    node.name

It may or may not be the same as

    node['fqdn']

or sometimes

    node[:ec2][:instance_id]
