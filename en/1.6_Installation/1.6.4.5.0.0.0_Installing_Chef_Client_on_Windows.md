Installing Chef Client on Windows
=================================

#### The following instructions walk you through the steps involved to prepare a Windows node for management with Chef and the `chef-client`.

If you would like a more automated approach to bootstrapping your
Windows nodes, please look Windows-specific knife bootstrap subcommands
that ship as part of the [Knife Windows
Bootstrap](Knife%20Windows%20Bootstrap.html "Knife Windows Bootstrap")
plugin.

##### *Use of these knife bootstrap subcommands is the preferred way to prepare a node for management by Chef.*

If you are using Windows 2008 R2 with Hosted Chef and would like to set
your node up as a workstation and a client, you can use the [Fast Start
Guide for
Windows](Fast%20Start%20Guide%20for%20Windows.html "Fast Start Guide for Windows").
This guide also contains a quick walkthrough on using recipes on the
client.

Install Chef
============

[Download the Chef Full Installer](http://opscode.com/chef/install.msi)
for Windows and open it. Choose defaults for any options.

Once it is installed there will be no icon for it. If needed, you can
confirm it was installed correctly with these commands in a new command
prompt window:

    C:\> tar --version
    bsdtar 2.8.3 - libarchive 2.8.3

    C:\> chef-client --version

You should see "Chef: 10.12.0" returned as the version number.

Configure Chef
==============

Now we will need to copy over the validation key and create the
client.rb so chef-client will be able to authenticate with your
organization or Chef Server.

### Copy over the validation key

First you will want to create a directory in C:\\ named "chef" so we can
put configuration information into it. You can move this directory to
another location, but you would need to change the paths to it in your
client.rb.

**You'll then want to copy the validation key onto this node:**

-   **Hosted Chef**  
     Copy your ORGANIZATION-validator.pem key to
    `C:\chef\ORGANIZATION-validator.pem`.

-   **Open Source Chef Server**  
     Copy your validation.pem key to `C:\chef\validation.pem`.
