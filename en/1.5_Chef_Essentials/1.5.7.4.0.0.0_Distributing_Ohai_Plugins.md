Opscode provides a [cookbook](http://cookbooks.opscode.com/cookbooks/ohai) for distributing custom Ohai plugins.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  

### Add cookbook to chef-repo

Download the cookbook to your [Chef
Repository](Chef%20Repository.html "Chef Repository").

    knife cookbook site install ohai
    INFO: Downloading ohai from the cookbooks site at version 0.9.0
    INFO: Cookbook saved: /Users/jtimberman/chef-repo/cookbooks/ohai.tar.gz
    INFO: Checking out the master branch.

    [ ... SNIP ... ]
    INFO: Cookbook ohai version 0.9.0 successfully vendored!

### Write custom plugins

See the [Writing Ohai
Plugins](Writing%20Ohai%20Plugins.html "Writing Ohai Plugins") page for
instructions on how to write new Ohai plugins. These files will go under
`cookbooks/ohai/files/default/plugins`. They should be Ruby files.

    $EDITOR cookbooks/ohai/files/default/plugins/my_plugin.rb

### Change the Plugin Path

If you wish to change the directory where the plugins are copied, edit
the cookbook attributes file and change the path for the
`node[:ohai][:plugin_path]` attribute.

    default[:ohai][:plugin_path] = "/etc/chef/ohai_plugins"

### Upload to your Chef Server

The cookbook needs to be uploaded to the Chef Server to be used.

    knife cookbook upload ohai
    INFO: Saving ohai
    INFO: Validating ruby files
    INFO: Validating templates
    INFO: Syntax OK
    INFO: Generating Metadata
    INFO: Uploading files
    [ ... SNIP ... ]

### Add the recipe to a run list

Add the `recipeOhai` to a node or role run list. Put it first to make
sure your custom plugins are loaded and available to other recipes. When
Chef [runs](Anatomy%20of%20a%20Chef%20Run.html "Anatomy of a Chef Run"),
during the compile phase the plugins will be copied into place and then
loaded and merged with the node. This does cause Ohai to be run twice
which can add a few seconds to the total run time of Chef.

### Additional Information

See the README.md of the Ohai cookbook for additional information.
