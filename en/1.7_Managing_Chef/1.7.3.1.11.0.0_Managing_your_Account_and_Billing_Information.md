Organization](Setup%20Opscode%20User%20and%20Organization.html "Setup Opscode User and Organization")

Management Console instead, return to [Hosted Chef Management
Console](Hosted%20Chef%20Management%20Console.html "Hosted Chef Management Console"),
and make the appropriate selection.**

Selecting the Organization to Edit
----------------------------------

From the *Manage Account* page of the Hosted Chef Management Console you
can update the details about your organization. The only information you
can change about your organization is the *Organization Full Name*
field. This field represents the formal way in which somebody would
address your organization. To change your Organization Full name,

1.  Log into [http://manage.opscode.com](http://manage.opscode.com),
2.  Click on "Organizations" in the upper right-hand corner,
3.  Click on "Manage Account" for the relevant organization,
4.  The Hosted Chef Management console will redirect you to the Account
    Management Tool.

From this tool, you can also switch between organization:

1.  Click on either "View/Edit Plan" or "Billing Details" depending on
    the task (see below).
2.  Organizations that you are a member of will appear in a drop down
    near the top of the page.

**You will need to be a member of the [billing-admins
group](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/Staging/Managing+Permissions+with+the+Hosted+Chef+Management+Console#ManagingPermissionswiththeHostedChefManagementConsole-Updatingpermissionsforthebillingadmin)
to view or modify the billing or plan information.** If you are not a
billing-admin you will see this error instead:
