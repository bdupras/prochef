Managing Environments through the Management Console
====================================================

**Chef 0.10.0+ only feature**  
Environments feature is only available in (and after) Chef 0.10.0.

### The Management Console allows users to create, read, update, delete environments, and to select a specific environment to view nodes and cookbooks in that environment.

Selecting an environment
------------------------

On the header of the Management Console, there is an Environment drop
down box where you can select either "none" or a specific environment.

If "none" is selected, the Management Console shows everything when you
view nodes and cookbooks; if a specific environment is selected, the
Management Console only shows the available objects in that environment
for nodes and cookbooks. For cookbooks, if you do not define any
restriction in the environment, the Management Console shows all
cookbooks.

When viewing a specific role, the per environment run list for the
selected environment shows up; if "none" or "\_default" is selected in
the Environment drop down box, or there is no environment specific run
list for the selected environment, the role page shows the "default" run
list.

Objects other than nodes, cookbooks, and roles are not affected by the
environment selection.

Listing Environments
--------------------

The List page under Environments tab shows all existing Environments.
Clicking the link of the Environment name allows you to view the
Environment. You can also select the Environment by clicking "Select"
next to the name; doing so is equivalent to selecting an environment
from the drop down box on the top of the page.

Viewing an Environment
----------------------

Click the name of the Environment on the List page under Environments
allows you to view the Environment. You are able to see the description,
cookbook version constraints, and attributes defined in the Environment
you are viewing.

Creating an Environment
-----------------------

By clicking the Create tab under Environments, you are able to create a
new Environment. In the Create form you can specify a name (required),
description, cookbook version constraints, and attributes.

Deleting an Environment
-----------------------

An Environment can be deleted by clicking the "delete" link on the List
page next to the name of the Environment; or by clicking the "Delete"
tab on the Show page when you view a specific Environment.
